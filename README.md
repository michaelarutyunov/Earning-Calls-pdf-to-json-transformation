    Guidelines for searching for speaker attribution:
    - Always check the WHOLE transcript from the beginning to the end for ALL variations of attributions for every speaker name and it's variations.
    - Speaker attribution is always separate from the speech by a formatting tag or a punctuation mark.
    - Speaker attribution always starts with the speaker name or it's variations.
    - Look for speaker changes in conversational context (e.g., after a question or statement by another speaker).
    - Pay special attention to paragraphs that begin with a name, especially after a question.
    - Look for paragraphs that begin with a known speaker name and it's variations followed immediately by speech.
    - When a speaker name or it's variation appears at the beginning of a paragraph and is immediately followed by words like "Well," "Thank you," "Look," etc., this is likely an attribution.
    - Consider name variations such as with/without middle initials or abbreviated names.
    - Speaker's name in the attribution can include speaker's job title and company.
    - Speaker attribution is normally preceded by a <LINEBREAK> tag or a combination of <MULTISPACE> and <LINEBREAK> tags, but may appear with NO formatting tags or punctuation at all.
    - Speaker attribution normally ends with a formatting tag or a punctuation mark.
    - Speaker attribution never contains a speech.
    - Two speaker attributions cannot appear next two each other. If they do, they are not speaker attributions.
    - Attribution for operator should always contain the word "Operator".

    Guidelines for searching for speaker attribution:
    - IMPORTANT: always check the WHOLE transcript from the beginning to the end for ALL variations of attributions for EVERY name variation of EACH speaker.
    - Look for paragraphs that begin with a known speaker name or it's variations immediately followed by a speech.
    - Look for speaker changes in conversational context (e.g., after a question or statement by another speaker).   
    - Pay attention to the job title and company name variations.
    - Speaker attributions cannot appear next two each other. If they do, they are not speaker attributions. There should always be a speech between attributions.
    - Attribution for operator should always contain the word "Operator".

    Attributions may come in a variety of formats and often inconsistent within the same transcript:
    Here are potential variations in speaker's name, job title and company formatting:
    - can have spelling variations in different parts of the transcript, including with/without middle initials, abbreviated names, inconsistent use of punctuation. 
    - can be in normal, bold, italic, underlined text, upper and title case.
    - can include punctuations marks like a dash, a colon, a period, an apostrophe, a a special symbol, formatting tags, or a combination of these.
    - cannot be separated by a text segment that is not a formatting tag.
    - can be followed by a punctuation and can be separated from it by a formatting tag or a space.
    
    Additionally:
    - If speaker's name is separated from the job title or company by a text segment that is not a formatting tag, then only speaker name should be a part of attribution.
    - If speaker's name is followed by a text segment that is not a formatting tag, then only speaker name should be a part of attribution.

    All these examples may be preceded by a <LINEBREAK> tag or a combination of <MULTISPACE> and <LINEBREAK> tags.
    All these examples may have a <LINEBREAK> tag or a combination of <MULTISPACE> and <LINEBREAK> tags between the attribution and the speech.
    Here is an example of a text where the speaker attribution and company are separated by a speech:
    * <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Name Surname <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Good morning, everybody. My first question relates to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Company Name) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital return.
    In this case the company name should be ignored and only speaker name should be a part of attribution.
