    <speaker_attribution_guidelines>
    Guidelines for speaker attribution:
    - Speaker attribution helps identify who is speaking before their statements.
    - For each speaker, check the WHOLE transcript from start to end for ALL variations of their speaker attributions.
    - Speaker attribution always starts with the speaker's name.
    - Speaker's name in the attribution can be followed by the speaker's job title and company.
    - In the attribution, the speaker's name, job title and company can be separated by a dash, a colon, formatting tags, or a combination of these.
    - In the attribution, the speaker's name, job title and company can NEVER be separated by a text segment that is not a formatting tag.
    - If speaker's name is separated from the job title or company by a speech, then only speaker name should be a part of attribution.
    - Speaker's name, job title and company in the attribution can be in normal or bold text, upper or title case, may include punctuations marks like a dash, a colon, a period, or an apostrophe.
    - Speaker's name, job title and company may be separated with a punctuation mark like a dash, a colon, or formatting tags, or a combination of these.
    - Pay close attention to the formatting tags around and between speaker's name, job title, company, and puntuation marks.
    - Speaker attribution is normally preceded by a <LINEBREAK> tag or a combination of <MULTISPACE> and <LINEBREAK> tags.
    - Speaker attribution often ends with a formatting tag or a punctuation mark. 
    - Attribution for operator should always contain the word "Operator".
