            "utterance": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm. As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average deposits were down 3% quarter-on-quarter while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter - implying an intra-quarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit inflows at quarter-end. It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full year NII outlook - which I will address at the end - still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Markets revenue was down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs reflecting the annualization of last year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted-average economic outlook. On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity closely. Spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter- on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. 3 Moving to Card Services and Auto - revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 billion were up 5% year-on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down 34% for debt and 6% for equity. In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter, as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates, and gross Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on- quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also leading to weakness in capex spending. In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments. And given the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets; and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run-rate impact of acquisitions. For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. 4 Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year. I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader macroeconomic environment - including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.

In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario planning for - whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment. ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"

Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just recalibrating things the right way. And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic - it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment - that'll be what it is. 5 ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................"

            "utterance": "Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out - those uncertainties are all still there, we highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those. ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 6"

Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there?

            "utterance": "Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is - it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate curve will have to go up a little bit. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March - in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits?

But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. John McDonald Analyst, Autonomous Research Q Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie - there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch - banks are going to stop lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense - that banks might be retrenching a lot here?

It just makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession - that's what that is.

The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation.

Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns - whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions.

And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds.

So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case assumption. Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the SCB. But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and we'll know soon enough what that actual number is. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up? .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

So, really, the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you should - for our planning - I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and I think if those things happen - I'm not saying they're going to happen - I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients - now would be the time to fix it. Do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer number one. Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very - we think - it's very, very secure.

That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know.

So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test - the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared - whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store - you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that - all of us - did that during COVID. All of us did that - if you could, those who could - did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

A lot of people are going to have - can take - actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward. You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 million - I don't know if you saw that - that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just before about interest rates - people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up.

And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call - the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook.

And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine - this is a little inside baseball now - the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it - like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line.

The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very - we're expecting it go up, but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan - there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, when you look at it - even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear - I can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for loans. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 15"

I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to - I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. If that's what they want, that's fine.

I'm curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is - consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting their cash balances and working capital - and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

And I do think it's just worth saying - I think you're sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates - that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business for all of us. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."

            "utterance": "When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move - or I would call excess cash was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash - so think even of a small companies, middle market companies, et cetera - that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and more competitive in rates. And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks - they've got sticky middle market deposits. If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more competitive on the rate for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class - there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I think they have already - as the Fed has raised rates, you've already seen - that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 16"

So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
