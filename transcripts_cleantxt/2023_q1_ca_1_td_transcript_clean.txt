IN NO WAY <LINEBREAK> DOES TD ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED <LINEBREAK> ON TD'S WEB SITE OR IN THIS TRANSCRIPT. USERS ARE ADVISED TO REVIEW THE WEBCAST (AVAILABLE AT TD.COM/INVESTOR ) ITSELF <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> AND TD'S REGULATORY FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION <LINEBREAK> From time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, <LINEBREAK> in other filings with Canadian regulators or the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other <LINEBREAK> communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and <LINEBREAK> others. All such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbour" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, <LINEBREAK> applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking <LINEBREAK> statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management's Discussion and Analysis ("2022 MD&A") in <LINEBREAK> the Bank's 2022 Annual Report under the heading "Economic Summary and Outlook", under the headings "Key Priorities for 2023" and <LINEBREAK> "Operating Environment and Outlook" for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, <LINEBREAK> and Wholesale Banking segments, and under the heading "2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023" for the Corporate segment, and in <LINEBREAK> other statements regarding the Bank's objectives and priorities for 2023 and beyond and strategies to achieve them, the regulatory <LINEBREAK> environment in which the Bank operates, and the Bank's anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements are typically <LINEBREAK> identified by words such as "will", "would", "should", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "intend", "estimate", "plan", "goal", "target", "may", and <LINEBREAK> "could". <LINEBREAK> By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and <LINEBREAK> uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory <LINEBREAK> environments, such risks and uncertainties - many of which are beyond the Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict <LINEBREAK> - may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could <LINEBREAK> cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, <LINEBREAK> interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance, liquidity, capital <LINEBREAK> adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors <LINEBREAK> include general business and economic conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; inflation, rising rates and <LINEBREAK> recession; the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the ability of the Bank to execute on <LINEBREAK> long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion and integration of acquisitions and <LINEBREAK> dispositions, business retention plans, and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security <LINEBREAK> breaches or technology failures) on the Bank's information technology, internet, network access or other voice or data communications <LINEBREAK> systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including <LINEBREAK> relating to the care and control of information, and other risks arising from the Bank's use of third-party service providers; the impact of new <LINEBREAK> and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory <LINEBREAK> guidance; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big <LINEBREAK> technology competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory <LINEBREAK> matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to the Bank's credit ratings; changes in foreign exchange rates, <LINEBREAK> interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for <LINEBREAK> funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and <LINEBREAK> methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the <LINEBREAK> occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the preceding list is <LINEBREAK> not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank's results. For more detailed information, <LINEBREAK> please refer to the "Risk Factors and Management" section of the 2022 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to <LINEBREAK> shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading "Significant Acquisitions" <LINEBREAK> or "Significant and Subsequent Events, and Pending Acquisitions" in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may be found on <LINEBREAK> www.td.com . All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, <LINEBREAK> should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on <LINEBREAK> the Bank's forward-looking statements. <LINEBREAK> Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2022 MD&A under <LINEBREAK> the heading "Economic Summary and Outlook", under the headings "Key Priorities for 2023" and "Operating Environment and Outlook" for <LINEBREAK> the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking segments, and <LINEBREAK> under the heading "2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023" for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed <LINEBREAK> quarterly reports to shareholders. Any forward-looking statements contained in this document represent the views of management only as of <LINEBREAK> the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial <LINEBREAK> position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may not <LINEBREAK> be appropriate for other purposes. The Bank does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may <LINEBREAK> be made from time to time by or on its behalf, except as required under applicable securities legislation. <LINEBREAK>

Good afternoon and welcome to TD Bank Group's First Quarter 2023 Investor <LINEBREAK> Presentation. Many of us are joining today's meeting from lands across North America. North America is <LINEBREAK> known as Turtle Island by many Indigenous communities. I am currently situated in Toronto. As such, I <LINEBREAK> would like to begin today's meeting by acknowledging that I am on the traditional territory of many nations, <LINEBREAK> including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the <LINEBREAK> Wendat peoples, and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples. We also <LINEBREAK> acknowledge that Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 signed with the Mississaugas of the Credit, and the <LINEBREAK> Williams Treaties signed with multiple Mississaugas and Chippewa bands. <LINEBREAK> We will begin today's presentation with remarks from Bharat Masrani, the Bank's CEO, after which Kelvin <LINEBREAK> Tran, the Bank's CFO, will present our first quarter operating results. Ajai Bambawale, Chief Risk Officer, <LINEBREAK> will then offer comments on credit quality, after which we will invite questions from pre-qualified analysts <LINEBREAK> and investors on the phone. Also present today to answer your questions are Michael Rhodes, Group <LINEBREAK> Head, Canadian Personal Banking; Paul Douglas, Group Head, Canadian Business Banking; Raymond <LINEBREAK> Chun, Group Head, Wealth Management and Insurance; Leo Salom, President and CEO, TD Bank, <LINEBREAK> America's Most Convenient Bank; and Riaz Ahmed, Group Head, Wholesale Banking. Please turn to Slide <LINEBREAK> 2. <LINEBREAK> At this time, I would like to caution our listeners that this presentation contains forward looking statements, <LINEBREAK> that there are risks that actual results could differ materially from what is discussed and that certain material <LINEBREAK> factors or assumptions were applied in making these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking <LINEBREAK> statements contained in this presentation represent the views of management and are presented for the <LINEBREAK> purpose of assisting the Bank's shareholders and analysts in understanding the Bank's financial position, <LINEBREAK> objectives and priorities, and anticipated financial performance. Forward-looking statements may not be <LINEBREAK> appropriate for other purposes. <LINEBREAK> I would also like to remind listeners that the Bank uses non-GAAP financial measures such as "adjusted" <LINEBREAK> results to assess each of its businesses and to measure overall Bank performance. The Bank believes that <LINEBREAK> adjusted results provide readers with a better understanding of how management views the Bank's <LINEBREAK> performance. Bharat will be referring to adjusted results in his remarks. Additional information on items of <LINEBREAK> note, the Bank's use of non-GAAP and other financial measures, the Bank's reported results and factors <LINEBREAK> and assumptions related to forward-looking information are all available in our Q1 2023 Report to <LINEBREAK> Shareholders. <LINEBREAK> With that, let me turn the presentation over to Bharat. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Brooke and thank you everyone for joining us today. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To start, I want to express that our thoughts are with all those impacted by the devastating earthquakes in <LINEBREAK> Turkey and Syria, including our colleagues, customers and communities, who have deep ties to these two <LINEBREAK> countries. TD has contributed directly to the relief efforts and enabled customers to do so as well, through <LINEBREAK> branches and online. Together, a collective effort can make a difference and provide some comfort during <LINEBREAK> these terrible hardships. <LINEBREAK> It's been a busy week and before I review our strong quarter and start to the fiscal year, I would like to <LINEBREAK> provide a few strategic updates. As you know on February 9th, we mutually agreed with First Horizon to <LINEBREAK> extend the close date to May 27th as provisioned in our contract. Since then, we have come to believe <LINEBREAK> that the deal is not expected to receive regulatory approval in time to close the transaction by that date. <LINEBREAK> Regulatory approval is not within the Bank's control. So, we are doing what is prudent and appropriate - <LINEBREAK> we have opened discussions with First Horizon about a potential additional extension. <LINEBREAK> I cannot speculate on when we will receive approval. I can tell you that we are fully committed to the <LINEBREAK> transaction. We have a robust Community Benefits Plan in place with broad community support across <LINEBREAK> our combined footprint and our teams have made progress on integration plans. This is a great <LINEBREAK> transaction that offers scale and new capabilities to our U.S. franchise. <LINEBREAK>

The <LINEBREAK> settlement we announced allows us to avoid the distraction and uncertainty of a long legal proceeding, <LINEBREAK> and is in the best interests of shareholders and the Bank. <LINEBREAK> And of course, yesterday, we closed the Cowen transaction. TD Securities and Cowen are a powerful <LINEBREAK> combination, accelerating our U.S. growth strategy and helping to create an integrated, North American <LINEBREAK> dealer with global reach. The acquisition of Cowen adds key capabilities to our growing global markets <LINEBREAK> platform - in U.S. equity sales and trading and in U.S. equity research. It also adds scale and industry <LINEBREAK> expertise across U.S. capital markets and M&A advisory. Congratulations to everyone on this important <LINEBREAK> milestone, and a very warm welcome to our over 1,500 new colleagues. I know I speak for Riaz and all of <LINEBREAK> TD Securities, when I say we are very excited for what we will accomplish, together. <LINEBREAK> Let me now turn to our first quarter performance. TD delivered a strong Q1. Earnings increased 8% to <LINEBREAK> $4.2 billion, and EPS rose 7% to $2.23. Revenue grew 16% year-over-year, reflecting margin expansion, <LINEBREAK> strong volume growth and our diversified business mix. We took advantage of this environment to <LINEBREAK> continue to invest in our business to drive future growth while delivering robust operating leverage. As <LINEBREAK> expected, we saw some credit normalization this quarter, but credit performance remained strong overall, <LINEBREAK> supported by consistent and disciplined underwriting practices. <LINEBREAK> TD's CET 1 ratio ended the quarter at 15.5% or 15% pro forma for the closing of the Cowen acquisition. <LINEBREAK> With TD's strong internal capital generation capabilities - and the various capital levers available to the <LINEBREAK> Bank, we continue to expect TD's CET 1 ratio to be comfortably above 11% post-closing of the First <LINEBREAK> Horizon transaction. <LINEBREAK> These strong results are matched by a brand that is second to none. TD was recently named one of the <LINEBREAK> 2023 Global Top 500 Most Valuable Brands by Brand Finance, earning the highest ranking in Canada. <LINEBREAK> Across our distribution channels, the Bank delivers personalized, connected, legendary experiences. For <LINEBREAK> the ninth consecutive year, the TD mobile app had the highest number of monthly active mobile users <LINEBREAK> among Canadian banks according to mobile analytics firm data.ai . <LINEBREAK> Let me now turn to each of our businesses and review some highlights from Q1. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segment delivered record earnings of $1.7 billion, <LINEBREAK> reflecting revenue growth of 17% and significant positive operating leverage. The Personal Bank <LINEBREAK> continued to demonstrate momentum, with sales of our Everyday Banking products up over 20% year <LINEBREAK> over-year and industry-leading market share gains in non-term deposits again this quarter, driven by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strength in branch banking. We saw record Q1 acquisition in the New to Canada customer segment and <LINEBREAK> announced an exclusive strategic relationship with CanadaVisa - one of the leading online sources of <LINEBREAK> Canadian immigration information, with over 2 million monthly visits. Through this relationship, TD will <LINEBREAK> help support newcomers as they navigate financial services while settling into their lives in Canada. We <LINEBREAK> also had record Q1 credit card spend and organic loan growth driven by a rebound in travel and our <LINEBREAK> compelling TD Aeroplan offering, coupled with our best ever quarter for digital acquisition for TD cards. In <LINEBREAK> our real estate secured lending business, our teams delivered robust retention rates and enhancements <LINEBREAK> in mobile mortgage specialist productivity, despite a softening housing market. The Business Bank <LINEBREAK> achieved double-digit loan growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And we were proud to collaborate <LINEBREAK> with the Federation of African Canadian Economics to help black business owners in their entrepreneurial <LINEBREAK> journeys, enabling them to access capital and scale their businesses. <LINEBREAK> Turning to the U.S., our U.S. Retail Bank delivered record earnings of US$1 billion, reflecting revenue <LINEBREAK> growth of 27% and significant positive operating leverage. With the contribution from our investment in <LINEBREAK> Schwab of US$222 million, segment earnings were US$1.2 billion. This quarter, enabled by our <LINEBREAK> investments in event streaming technology, TD launched deposit balance thresholds alerts, the first of <LINEBREAK> several self-serve alerts that will further enhance customer convenience and experience. We delivered <LINEBREAK> strong loan growth year-over-year. Led by 18% growth in mortgages and 9% growth in cards, personal <LINEBREAK> loans were up 11%. And TD demonstrated continued momentum in the middle-market and C&I space, <LINEBREAK> with business loans up 9%, excluding PPP loan forgiveness. Finally, this quarter, we were proud to <LINEBREAK> announce a 20-year extension of our agreement with Delaware North - keeping Boston's beloved <LINEBREAK> landmark arena named as "TD Garden" through 2045. <LINEBREAK>

Revenue was up 4%, <LINEBREAK> as higher insurance volumes and the benefit of higher interest rates helped offset a challenging market <LINEBREAK> environment. In TD Direct Investing, we took the #1 spot in the Globe and Mail's annual ranking of digital <LINEBREAK> brokers, and increased market share of new account acquisition quarter-over-quarter. In TD Asset <LINEBREAK> Management, TD regained its position as the #1 money manager for Canadian pension assets, and <LINEBREAK> widened its lead versus competitors as the #1 Canadian institutional asset manager. Highlighting the <LINEBREAK> breadth of our capabilities, several TD Asset Management ETFs and mutual funds - across equities, <LINEBREAK> fixed income, and balanced funds were recognized this quarter with FundGrade A+ awards. On the <LINEBREAK> Insurance side, our expansion into Small Business Insurance will launch in the coming months. As the #1 <LINEBREAK> Direct-to-Consumer insurer in Canada, this is a natural extension for us to leverage our expertise to <LINEBREAK> deliver exceptional insurance experiences for small business owners. <LINEBREAK> In our Wholesale Banking business, we delivered net income of $347 million, with revenues roughly flat <LINEBREAK> year-over-year. The impact of lower underwriting and trading revenues was offset by higher global <LINEBREAK> transaction banking and lending revenues as we continue to support our clients through market cycles. <LINEBREAK> This quarter, TD Securities acted as financial advisor to GIC and Dream Industrial REIT on their <LINEBREAK> acquisition of Summit Industrial Income REIT. Our Wholesale Banking team also acted as joint book <LINEBREAK> runner on the Government of Canada's $500 million Ukraine Sovereignty Bond, to assist the Government <LINEBREAK> of Ukraine in providing essential services to Ukrainians and restoring energy infrastructure. And as I <LINEBREAK> mentioned earlier, Cowen is now part of TD Securities. With robust integration plans in place, work is <LINEBREAK> already underway to tap the combined strengths of the business and extend our competitive advantage in <LINEBREAK> the market. <LINEBREAK> Guided by our purpose, TD is committed to creating value for all our stakeholders. I am proud that the <LINEBREAK> Bank was listed in the DJSI World Index for the ninth consecutive year. TD is one of 6 banks listed in the <LINEBREAK> DJSI North American Index - and the only North American bank included in the World Index. The Bank <LINEBREAK> was also recently recognized with a "Top 10% S&P Global ESG score" - again standing out from its <LINEBREAK> peers as the only North American bank to be listed in the top 10%. And, TD Bank, America's Most <LINEBREAK> Convenient Bank was recognized as one of America's Best Employers for Veterans by Forbes for the <LINEBREAK> third consecutive year. This recognition is a reflection of our commitment to the communities we serve. <LINEBREAK> Earlier this week, as part of the TD Ready Challenge, we were pleased to announce a total of $10 million <LINEBREAK> in grants to ten non-profit and charitable organizations that are working on solutions to help those who <LINEBREAK> may be disproportionately affected by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Later <LINEBREAK> this month, TD will release its 2022 ESG reporting suite, including our Climate Action Plan. We are <LINEBREAK> excited to share the outcomes of a year of effort and accomplishments by thousands of dedicated TD <LINEBREAK> colleagues, who transformed our aspirations into action. Our TD bankers continue to deliver for all of our <LINEBREAK> stakeholders, and it is a privilege to work alongside them every day. I would like to thank them for all they <LINEBREAK> do to make TD the Better Bank. <LINEBREAK> I will end by noting that this is Paul Douglas's last earnings call as Group Head, Canadian Business <LINEBREAK> Banking. Barbara Hooper will assume leadership of this segment. Paul's almost 47-year TD career is <LINEBREAK> filled with remarkable achievements and success. He and his team have built one of Canada's premier <LINEBREAK> business banks, known across the market for their dedication to their customers. Paul has also built the <LINEBREAK> best team of business bankers in the country, and leaves behind a tremendous bench of talent that will <LINEBREAK> continue to drive growth. I have known Paul throughout my entire time at TD and want to thank him for his <LINEBREAK> partnership, support, and significant contributions to the Bank's success over many decades. Paul will <LINEBREAK> assume a newly created position as Chair, Canadian Business Banking and will also serve as a Special <LINEBREAK> Advisor to me. Congratulations to Paul, and I look forward to continuing to benefit from his wise counsel <LINEBREAK> as we build for the future. <LINEBREAK> With that, I'll turn things over to Kelvin. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> For Q1, the Bank reported earnings of $1.6 billion and EPS of $0.82, down 58% and 59% respectively. <LINEBREAK> Reported earnings include the Stanford litigation settlement, a net loss from mitigation of impact from <LINEBREAK> interest rate volatility to closing capital on the First Horizon acquisition and the recognition of a provision <LINEBREAK> for income taxes in connection with the Canada Recovery Dividend and increase in the Canadian federal <LINEBREAK> tax rate for fiscal 2022. Adjusted earnings were $4.2 billion, and adjusted EPS was $2.23, up 8% and 7%, <LINEBREAK> respectively. Reported revenue increased 8% and includes a net loss from mitigation of impact from <LINEBREAK> interest rate volatility to closing capital on the First Horizon acquisition. Adjusted revenue increased 16% <LINEBREAK> reflecting margin and volume growth in the Personal and Commercial Banking businesses and the impact <LINEBREAK> of FX translation. Provision for credit losses was $690 million, compared with $72 million in the first <LINEBREAK> quarter last year. Reported expenses increased 39% primarily reflecting the Stanford litigation settlement <LINEBREAK> and higher acquisition and integration-related charges. Adjusted expenses increased 11%, driven by <LINEBREAK> higher employee-related expenses, the impact of FX translation, and higher spend supporting business <LINEBREAK> growth. On our Q4 call, I noted that we expected adjusted expense growth excluding FX to moderate in <LINEBREAK> fiscal 2023 on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We saw that this quarter, with adjusted expense growth <LINEBREAK> moderating sequentially as we continue to prioritize our investments. Our goal of delivering positive <LINEBREAK> operating leverage over the medium-term remains unchanged. Absent the retailer partners' net share of <LINEBREAK> the profits from the U.S. strategic card portfolio, adjusted expenses increased 10.4% ex-FX. Reported <LINEBREAK> total bank PTPP was down 26% year-over-year primarily reflecting the Stanford litigation settlement. <LINEBREAK> Consistent with prior quarters, Slide 26 shows how we calculate adjusted total bank PTPP and operating <LINEBREAK> leverage, removing the impact of the U.S. strategic card portfolio, along with the impact of foreign <LINEBREAK> currency translation, and the insurance fair value charge. Adjusted total bank PTPP was up 14% after <LINEBREAK> these modifications. Please turn to Slide 12. <LINEBREAK> Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking net income for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 7% year <LINEBREAK> over-year. Revenue increased 17%, reflecting higher margins and volume growth. Average loan volumes <LINEBREAK> rose 8%, reflecting 6% growth in personal volumes and 14% growth in business volumes. Average <LINEBREAK> deposits rose 3%, reflecting 8% growth in personal deposits and a 5% decrease in business deposits. Net <LINEBREAK> interest margin was 2.80%, up 10 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher <LINEBREAK> deposit margins reflecting rising interest rates, partially offset by lower loan margins. While many factors <LINEBREAK> can impact margins - including the path of short-term rates, tractor on and off rates, customer activity and <LINEBREAK> competitive market dynamics - and margins may bounce around quarter to quarter, we currently expect <LINEBREAK> net interest margin expansion to moderate for the remainder of fiscal 2023. Total PCL of $327 million <LINEBREAK> increased $98 million sequentially. Total PCL as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.25%, <LINEBREAK> up 8 basis points sequentially. Noninterest expenses increased 10% year-over year, reflecting higher <LINEBREAK> spend supporting business growth, including technology and employee-related expenses. Please turn to <LINEBREAK> Slide 13. <LINEBREAK> U.S. Retail segment reported net income for the quarter was US$1.2 billion, up 17% year-over-year. <LINEBREAK> Adjusted net income was US$1.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year. U.S. Retail Bank reported net income <LINEBREAK> was US$955 million, up 18%, primarily reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by higher non-interest <LINEBREAK> expenses including acquisition and integration-related charges for the First Horizon acquisition and higher <LINEBREAK> PCL. U.S. Retail Bank adjusted net income was US$1 billion, up 26%. Revenue increased 27% year <LINEBREAK> over-year, reflecting higher deposit margins and loan volumes, partially offset by lower loan margins and <LINEBREAK> deposit volumes, lower overdraft fees, and lower income from PPP loan forgiveness. Average loan <LINEBREAK> volumes increased 9% year-over-year. Personal loans increased 11%, reflecting strong originations, <LINEBREAK> lower prepayments and higher credit card sale volumes. Business loans increased 6%, reflecting strong <LINEBREAK> originations, new customer growth, higher commercial line utilization and increased customer activity, <LINEBREAK> partially offset by PPP loan forgiveness. Excluding PPP loans, business loans increased 9%. Average <LINEBREAK> deposit volumes, excluding sweep deposits, were down 2% year-over-year. Personal deposits were flat, <LINEBREAK> business deposits declined 4% and sweep deposits decreased 15%. Net interest margin was 3.29%, up <LINEBREAK> 16 basis points sequentially, as higher deposit margins reflecting the rising interest rate environment were <LINEBREAK> partially offset by lower loan margins and negative balance sheet mix. While many factors can impact <LINEBREAK> margins - including the path of short-term rates, tractor on and off rates, customer activity and <LINEBREAK>

Total PCL was US$149 million, a <LINEBREAK> decrease of US$20 million sequentially. The U.S. Retail net PCL ratio, including only the Bank's share of <LINEBREAK> PCL for the U.S. strategic card portfolio, as an annualized percentage of credit volume was 0.34%, lower <LINEBREAK> by 6 basis points sequentially. Reported expenses increased 22% and include acquisition and integration <LINEBREAK> related charges for the First Horizon acquisition. Adjusted expenses were up 16%, reflecting higher <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> employee-related expenses, credit card growth-related expenses and other business investments. The <LINEBREAK> contribution from TD's investment in Schwab was US$222 million, up 11% from a year ago, reflecting <LINEBREAK> higher net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses, lower asset management fees and lower <LINEBREAK> trading revenue. Please turn to Slide 14. <LINEBREAK> Wealth Management and Insurance net income for the quarter was $550 million, down 14% year-over <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year. Revenue increased 4%, reflecting higher margins, an increase in fair value of investments <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> supporting claims liabilities and higher insurance volumes, partially offset by lower volumes and lower <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transaction and fee-based revenue in wealth. Insurance claims increased 29% year-over-year, reflecting <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the impact of changes in the discount rate which resulted in a similar increase in the fair value of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> investments supporting claims liabilities reported in non-interest income, increased driving activity and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> inflationary costs, partially offset by fewer severe weather-related events. Non-interest expenses were flat <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year-over-year, reflecting higher spend supporting business growth, including higher employee-related <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expenses and technology costs, partially offset by lower variable compensation. Assets under <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting market depreciation. Assets under administration <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> decreased 3% year-over-year, reflecting market depreciation, partially offset by net asset growth. Please <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> turn to Slide 15. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Wholesale Banking reported net income for the quarter was $331 million, a decrease of 24% year-over <LINEBREAK> year, reflecting higher non-interest expenses and PCL. Adjusted net income was $347 million, down 20% <LINEBREAK> year-over-year. Revenue was $1.3 billion, largely unchanged year-over-year, reflecting lower trading <LINEBREAK> related revenue and underwriting fees, offset by higher global transaction banking and lending revenue. <LINEBREAK> PCL for the quarter was $32 million, an increase of $6 million from the prior quarter. Reported expenses <LINEBREAK> increased 16% and included acquisition and integration-related charges primarily for the Cowen <LINEBREAK> acquisition. Adjusted expenses increased 13% reflecting continued investments in Wholesale Banking's <LINEBREAK> U.S. dollar strategy, including the hiring of banking, sales and trading, and technology professionals, <LINEBREAK> higher severance, and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Please turn to Slide 16. <LINEBREAK> The Corporate segment reported net loss of $2.6 billion in the quarter, compared with a reported net loss <LINEBREAK> of $227 million in the first quarter last year. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects the Stanford <LINEBREAK> litigation settlement, a net loss from mitigation of impact from interest rate volatility to closing capital on <LINEBREAK> the First Horizon acquisition, the recognition of a provision for income taxes in connection with the <LINEBREAK> Canada Recovery Dividend and increase in the Canadian federal tax rate for fiscal 2022, and higher net <LINEBREAK> corporate expenses. Adjusted net loss for the quarter was $140 million, compared with an adjusted net <LINEBREAK> loss of $127 million in the first quarter last year. Please turn to Slide 17. <LINEBREAK> The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 15.5%, down 69 basis points sequentially. We had <LINEBREAK> strong internal capital generation this quarter, which added 42 basis points to CET 1. This was more than <LINEBREAK> offset by an increase in RWA net of FX, which decreased CET 1 by 62 basis points. We saw a 14 basis <LINEBREAK> point increase in CET 1 related to the issuance of common shares under our Dividend Reinvestment <LINEBREAK> Plan. Relating to the First Horizon acquisition, a net loss from the mitigation of impact from interest rate <LINEBREAK> volatility to closing capital decreased CET 1 by 13 basis points and an FX hedge decreased CET1 by 6 <LINEBREAK> basis points. Previously announced regulatory changes also impacted our CET 1 this quarter. We saw a <LINEBREAK> 16 basis point decrease in CET 1 related to the Canada Recovery Dividend and an 8 basis point <LINEBREAK> decrease related to the elimination of the transitional arrangements for expected credit losses. Finally, the <LINEBREAK> previously announced Stanford litigation settlement decreased CET 1 by 23 basis points this quarter. <LINEBREAK> RWA including FX increased 2.8% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting higher Credit Risk RWA. Credit Risk <LINEBREAK> RWA increased $16.8 billion, or 4%, mainly reflecting higher volumes, asset quality reflecting further <LINEBREAK> credit normalization and parameter updates, and methodology changes in preparation for Basel III <LINEBREAK> reforms. Market Risk RWA decreased $3.4 billion, or 15%, reflecting lower exposures and tightening <LINEBREAK> credit spreads. The leverage ratio was 4.8% this quarter, and the LCR ratio was 141%, both well above <LINEBREAK> published regulatory minimums. <LINEBREAK>

Please turn to Slide 18. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Gross impaired loan formations increased by 2 basis points, to 16 basis points quarter-over-quarter, <LINEBREAK> driven by Canadian Commercial Banking, primarily related to a new formation in the health and social <LINEBREAK> services sector, and some further normalization of credit performance, largely reflected in the Canadian <LINEBREAK> and U.S. consumer lending portfolios. Please turn to Slide 19. <LINEBREAK> Gross impaired loans were stable quarter-over-quarter and remained at cyclically low levels. Please turn <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to Slide 20. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Recall that our presentation reports PCL ratios both gross and net of the partner's share of the U.S. <LINEBREAK> strategic card PCLs. We remind you that U.S. Card PCLs recorded in the Corporate segment are fully <LINEBREAK> absorbed by our partners and do not impact the Bank's net income. The Bank's provision for credit losses <LINEBREAK> increased 3 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 32 basis points. The increase was largely recorded in the <LINEBREAK> Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segment. Please turn to Slide 21. <LINEBREAK> The Bank's impaired PCL was $553 million, an increase of $99 million quarter-over-quarter and primarily <LINEBREAK> related to some further normalization of credit performance largely reflected in the consumer lending <LINEBREAK> portfolios. The Bank's current quarter impaired PCL rate remained well below 2019 levels. Performing <LINEBREAK> PCL of $137 million this quarter was largely recorded in the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking <LINEBREAK> and Wholesale Banking segments. Please turn to Slide 22. <LINEBREAK> The allowance for credit losses increased by $113 million quarter-over-quarter, reflecting volume growth <LINEBREAK> and credit conditions, including some deterioration in the economic outlook, partially offset by the impact <LINEBREAK> of foreign exchange. The Bank's allowance coverage remains elevated to account for ongoing uncertainty <LINEBREAK> relating to the economic trajectory and credit performance. <LINEBREAK> In summary, the Bank's credit performance was strong again this quarter. However, as anticipated, key <LINEBREAK> credit metrics continue to rise from cyclically low levels experienced last year, with this trend most evident <LINEBREAK> in the consumer lending portfolios. Looking forward, while results may vary by quarter, I continue to <LINEBREAK> expect total PCLs to be in the range of 35 to 45 basis points in 2023, as credit performance continues to <LINEBREAK> normalize, and we progress along the economic path. TD remains well positioned given we are <LINEBREAK> adequately provisioned, we have a strong capital position, and we have a business that is broadly <LINEBREAK> diversified across products and geographies. <LINEBREAK> With that, operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> QUESTION AND ANS WER <LINEBREAK> Operator <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is from Meny Grauman from Scotiabank. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Meny Grauman - Scotia Capital - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Few questions on First Horizon, Bharat, you addressed it in your opening comments in terms of <LINEBREAK> renegotiating of the contract. I'm just wondering what extension date are you looking for, for that new <LINEBREAK> contract? <LINEBREAK>

I think it's premature for me to give you any specific dates. <LINEBREAK> We are thinking through as to what might be appropriate and when the timing is right, we will certainly let <LINEBREAK> you know. <LINEBREAK> Meny Grauman - Scotia Capital - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And just as a follow-up to that, as a result of these negotiations, could the purchase price change? Is that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> something that is a potential? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, we've just initiated the negotiations. And once the negotiations are finalized, we will be sure to give <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you further details. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Meny Grauman - Scotia Capital - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. And then just a final one on the same topic. Just wondering about the nature of the delay given that <LINEBREAK> the fact that the commentary that we're hearing comes so soon after the contract was extended to the <LINEBREAK> end of May. So I'm wondering, is the issue a procedural issue? Or is it something more substantive? How <LINEBREAK> would you sort of describe the delay as you see it? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As we've discussed previously, we are really excited about this transaction. We worked very hard to date <LINEBREAK> and continue to work very very hard. And our planning for integration continues. We've set up an <LINEBREAK> integration management office. I was thrilled that we announced our Community Benefits Plans very <LINEBREAK> recently, which was very important for the communities in which we operate. So really excited about what <LINEBREAK> this transaction does for our U.S. franchise. <LINEBREAK> As far as timing goes, unfortunately, I can't tell you any more than what I've said in my remarks. Yes, we <LINEBREAK> did extend the deal till May 27th since then. We believe that we will not be able to close this transaction by <LINEBREAK> that date and therefore, as you would expect us to, have started to talk about an extension with First <LINEBREAK> Horizon. <LINEBREAK> Doug Young - Desjardins - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Just a few CET1 related questions. I mean, TD had negative organic capital generation this quarter about <LINEBREAK> negative 20 basis points so just a few items I want to get some clarity on. Hoping you can dig into the <LINEBREAK> asset quality drag of 21 basis points. Is that just normal migration? Or can you kind of elaborate. <LINEBREAK> Ajai Bambawale - TD - Group Head and Chief Risk Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes, it's Ajai. So let me take asset quality. You would have noticed the increase there is $6.8 billion. <LINEBREAK> And there are really two drivers of that. One is normal course non-retail parameter updates that were <LINEBREAK> made. And we make these annually, so we actually put it through in Q1. And then the second driver is <LINEBREAK> credit normalization and as I said in my prepared remarks, that credit normalization is occurring largely in <LINEBREAK> the consumer portfolios, both for Canada and the U.S. Hopefully that's helpful. <LINEBREAK> Doug Young - Desjardins - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It is. Can you split the two in terms of which one was more impactful? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

The balance is credit migration. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Doug Young - Desjardins - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. And then second, the CET1 impact from the Basel III changes coming in Q2, it looks <LINEBREAK> like you had parameter updates, because of Basel III that came through in Q1 -- can you talk about is <LINEBREAK> there additional hit or benefit that you're going to have in Q2 from the upcoming Basel III changes? <LINEBREAK> Kelvin Tran - TD - Chief Financial Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's Kelvin. I'll take that one. Correct. In Q2, we expect the impact of Basel III to be small either way. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Doug Young - Desjardins - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay and I know, Bharat, you said this and Kelvin, you said this, I mean with First Horizon, CET1 <LINEBREAK> comfortably above 11%. I guess the question I've got is, would that be the case even if the deal <LINEBREAK> closed right now? And does that factor in any other actions? Like does that factor in selling additional <LINEBREAK> stakes in Schwab? Does that factor in with loan sales? I'm just curious if you can give some context to <LINEBREAK> what that means because I think that's one area that I'm getting a lot of questions on. <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, Doug, let's look at -- and I heard some of the noise around capital. Let's look at what TD's record <LINEBREAK> has been on this. I mean, look at the last couple of years, our internal capital generation earnings less <LINEBREAK> dividends is a simple way to do it. It's about 40 basis points per quarter. The DRIP contributes about 13 <LINEBREAK> basis points per quarter. That allows us to support our customers' activity through RWA growth, which <LINEBREAK> over the last five quarters is about 15 to 20 basis points. The first quarter was unusual because I think <LINEBREAK> Ajai provided some of the explanations to you. <LINEBREAK> So the Bank's capital flexibility is immense and that's why I was quite happy to say that at the closing of <LINEBREAK> First Horizon we will be comfortably over 11%. But as you can see, there's a pathway to a much higher <LINEBREAK> capital level, and that will depend on what the requirements are that will be announced from time to time. <LINEBREAK> So feel very comfortable with where the Bank's position is on capital. We have a lot of capital levers as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> well. And so I think the noise around this, I'm not sure that I really understand. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Doug Young - Desjardins - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, I guess maybe just to ask it another way, is that comfortably above 11% organic? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's my view. Yes, I've said this that we think we're going to be over 11% -- comfortably over 11% and <LINEBREAK> then I gave you some of the calculations as to why it even goes higher over time, so we feel <LINEBREAK> very comfortable with our capital position. And I know, Doug, you didn't ask, but Meny asked me what <LINEBREAK> negotiations would be. And I'm not going to talk about any specific issues on those negotiations with First <LINEBREAK> Horizon. We've just started a discussion. We have a fantastic relationship. It's a great franchise. And so <LINEBREAK> we'll see where we get to. <LINEBREAK>

You <LINEBREAK> might be confused by the feedback on capital, I guess. But -- it has to do with where you ended up this <LINEBREAK> quarter versus where people expected you to end up and then applying the pro forma impact of Cowen <LINEBREAK> and First Horizon and you get to a number closer to 11%. I just want to know what you have in the back <LINEBREAK> of your mind or we'd like to know just to get more comfortable with that comfortably above 11% figure? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'm not sure how you calculate your numbers, Gabe. So at some point, I'll get a chance to look at your <LINEBREAK> numbers. But the numbers I gave you, there is a pathway here for TD to be in excess of 12% by next <LINEBREAK> year. And this is even after closing First Horizon and Cowen. And so when you look at the first fiscal half <LINEBREAK> of next year, we think we have a clear pathway to be over 12%. And if the timing were to change, we've <LINEBREAK> got other capital levers. So I don't know what else I can tell you to clarify it further. I mean that's the way <LINEBREAK> we are thinking about it and feel very comfortable. <LINEBREAK> Gabriel Dechaine - National Bank Financial - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Well, how about this then? Some recent events in the Canadian banking space have led some <LINEBREAK> banks to target a minimum capital level of 11.5%. Are you suggesting that temporarily, anyway, you <LINEBREAK> would be -- let's say, 11% or just slightly above that. You're fine being at that level and working your way <LINEBREAK> to 12% organically -- post-transaction closing. Is that correct? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, there are a lot of assumptions you are making there. I'm giving you even after closing First Horizon <LINEBREAK> and Cowen, we would exceed 12% in the first fiscal half of next year. If the timing were to change, we've <LINEBREAK> got other capital levers, as you know. I thought I'm being very clear, Gabe. <LINEBREAK> Ebrahim Poonawala - BofA Securities - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bharat, just wanted to follow up on the deal. Two questions. One, should we be concerned that <LINEBREAK> maybe there is a supervisory issue in the U.S. that could have an impact on your organic business in the <LINEBREAK> United States as we think about TD Bank USA, your ability to grow or any of that? Can you answer that <LINEBREAK> question? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ebrahim, I can't comment on our confidential discussions with our regulators. That is an area that no bank <LINEBREAK> ventures into. But with respect to First Horizon, we continue to work with our regulators as part of our <LINEBREAK> application process, and we continue to do that. I can't comment any further. <LINEBREAK> I think the other questions you're asking me are hypothetical in nature. We continue to grow our bank, <LINEBREAK> Leo does a great job, six new stores were opened and I'm sure Leo would be happy to answer the loan <LINEBREAK> growth we're having and the tremendous momentum we have in the U.S. <LINEBREAK>

No, I think again, Bharat, I'm sure you appreciate we are in uncharted waters here. The only proxy <LINEBREAK> parallel comes to mind is M&T Hudson City, which took three years between announcement and close. <LINEBREAK> And I think that's what some investors are trying to handicap. <LINEBREAK> Maybe, I guess, the second question for you as someone putting up US$13.4 billion to buy First Horizon. <LINEBREAK> Just talk to us how do you get comfort around franchise attrition, right? Like have you heard about that <LINEBREAK> from investors? It is an extremely competitive market. If I'm an employee at First Horizon getting called <LINEBREAK> from 15 other banks, like how do you retain that and make sure there's not meaningful attrition in the <LINEBREAK> franchise if, let's say, the deal timing gets pushed out by 12 months? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Again, I can't comment on timing but when we announced the deal, the structure we had put in place was <LINEBREAK> to make sure that we've got more than adequate retention, and we feel happy about <LINEBREAK> that. First Horizon as a franchise continues to perform in line with expectations as shared during the <LINEBREAK> acquisition announcement in February of 2022. We are very happy with the transaction and continue to <LINEBREAK> work hard to get it over the closing over the finish line. <LINEBREAK> Scott Chan - Canaccord Genuity - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'll stay away from First Horizon and maybe concentrate on Cowen. Riaz, on Cowen what are you seeing <LINEBREAK> on the ground there in terms of now and when you announced the transaction? I know it's been difficult <LINEBREAK> capital markets, but is Cowen going to be operated separately still? Or do you still have collaboration or <LINEBREAK> some integration plans between the two? <LINEBREAK> Riaz Ahmed - TD - Group Head, Wholesale Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Scott. Look, first, on the closing yesterday, I cannot demonstrate to you the amount of exuberance that <LINEBREAK> both the TD Securities leadership and folks and Cowen leadership and folks were feeling yesterday. <LINEBREAK> There was just an amazing amount of energy in the room as we announced the closing. We've done a lot <LINEBREAK> of pre-integration work. And coming into the closing, there will be some short period of time, let's say, a <LINEBREAK> few weeks during which we need to continue to operate separately in order to finish all our regulatory and <LINEBREAK> functional and business model organization structures as we bring the broker dealers together. And then <LINEBREAK> we'll lead towards a full integration soon after that. <LINEBREAK> So I'd say people are very excited to go. We've got an early operating model in place, a go-to-market <LINEBREAK> strategy in place and there's just a tremendous amount of excitement. I'd say even more yesterday than <LINEBREAK> we had at the date of the announcement 7 months ago. So it's really, really exciting, and we're feeling <LINEBREAK> very positive about it. And Jeff Solomon and his team as well as the TD Securities leadership, just very <LINEBREAK> excited to get together and get on with growing our business. <LINEBREAK> Scott Chan - Canaccord Genuity - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Have you passed out any cost or revenue synergies over the medium term? I assume it's mostly the latter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> potential. And I don't know if there's examples that you see right now on it? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Riaz Ahmed - TD - Group Head, Wholesale Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes. I'd say we're basically at the same place we were at the time when we announced the transaction, <LINEBREAK> Scott, when we talked about having $300 million to $350 million of revenue synergies, and we said that <LINEBREAK> we would add about US$100 million in net income by year three. And as you know, we did not announce <LINEBREAK> any expense synergies at the time of the transaction. <LINEBREAK>

I want to try something very specific as I understand <LINEBREAK> you're not going to comment on more general type questions. The OCC released its schedule of <LINEBREAK> Community Reinvestment Act evaluations on February 28th so that date is obviously interesting between <LINEBREAK> when you provided the last update and the more current update. And that schedule shows that TD will be <LINEBREAK> reviewed in September of this year. Are the results of that evaluation something that's required for this <LINEBREAK> merger approval? Is that one of the potential reasons for the delay? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes. Let's not talk about the delay in First Horizon, because I think I've said enough on that. Regarding <LINEBREAK> CRA, our current rating is outstanding. And when you say that the exams will be done in September, I <LINEBREAK> don't know, Leo, I think this is the longest exam period that goes on before you get any reports back. <LINEBREAK> Leo Salom - TD - President and CEO, TD Bank America's Most Convenient Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes. And Paul, just to be clear, on an annual basis, the OCC will review an institution on a <LINEBREAK> number of different risk ratings, including their CRA rating. So that is the standard operating procedure, <LINEBREAK> that's not tied to any transaction. It's part of the normal regulatory review process. <LINEBREAK> Paul Holden - CIBC - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Understand. That's helpful. A question on deposits. We saw a drawdown in average deposit balances in <LINEBREAK> the U.S., both retail and business. And I was wondering if you can give us any characterization on how <LINEBREAK> you view current deposits between, let's say, excess savings and core deposits? And I guess what I'm <LINEBREAK> really trying to get at is, where do we think the deposits stabilize maybe in terms of when and what level? <LINEBREAK> Any insight you could provide there would be, I think, helpful. <LINEBREAK> Leo Salom - TD - President and CEO, TD Bank America's Most Convenient Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. I think what we are seeing, as a result of the increase in rates <LINEBREAK> is just building rate sensitivity. I think earlier over the past two quarters, we were seeing a little bit of the <LINEBREAK> excess savings from the pandemic relief efforts being drawn down or consumed. I think what you're <LINEBREAK> seeing now is just the natural rate sensitivity in terms of where rates are and your more rate-sensitive <LINEBREAK> clients. So think in the consumer side, your mass affluent high net worth clients and on the commercial <LINEBREAK> side, your more institutional clients, looking for either more attractive higher priced deposit solutions or in <LINEBREAK> some cases, off balance sheet investment alternatives. So you're seeing that play out and I would expect <LINEBREAK> as long as rates continue to be where they are and or continue to increase, I think you'll see some degree <LINEBREAK> of rate sensitivity. I will point you though to the composition of the U.S., we are a very liquid institution, our <LINEBREAK> excess deposit position is quite strong and then the composition having a strong core checking account <LINEBREAK> base in our retail and commercial businesses, should make us more resilient over the cycle. So from my <LINEBREAK> standpoint, I think we've got a very strong franchise and we continue to acquire clients at a very healthy <LINEBREAK> clip. Just to give you one final stat, this quarter, just on a year-on-year basis, core checking account <LINEBREAK> volumes were up 13%. So we're continuing to see strong momentum there and I would expect us to be <LINEBREAK> able to continue to grow the franchise. <LINEBREAK> Paul Holden - CIBC - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's helpful and then follow-up to that, Leo and this will be my last question, in terms of that movement <LINEBREAK> out of deposits and into wealth products or as you call the off balance sheet, is this an opportunity to grow <LINEBREAK> that wealth franchise in the U.S.? I think it was one of your strategic priorities when you moved down <LINEBREAK> there, are you seeing increasing opportunity? <LINEBREAK>

I'll certainly ask Ray to chime in. But growing the Wealth franchise in the U.S. is absolutely one of <LINEBREAK> the key priorities and I would describe that on a number of different fronts. We have got the mass affluent <LINEBREAK> opportunity in the stores themselves and Ray can talk a little bit more about the fact that we are growing <LINEBREAK> our financial advisers in the stores. There's the continued growth of the high net worth franchise aligned <LINEBREAK> with our retail business. And increasingly, we are seeing nice success in terms of the collaboration that's <LINEBREAK> taking place between our Wealth and Commercial Banking teams. In fact, we did see some outflows in <LINEBREAK> the Commercial Banking deposit front. What I didn't mention to you is that US$1.3 billion over the last two <LINEBREAK> quarters of that outflow ended up in our Wealth franchise. So we are systematically trying to retain that <LINEBREAK> client wallet inside the franchise and that will be a big area of focus for us going forward. Ray, I don't <LINEBREAK> know if there's anything you'd like to add. <LINEBREAK> Raymond Chun - TD - Group Head, Wealth Management & Insurance <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The only thing I'd add, Paul, is in Canada we have figured out a model that generates significant <LINEBREAK> partnership between our Branch Banking and Wealth Management and we're taking that model into <LINEBREAK> the United States and as Leo said, targeting the mass affluent clients and we have a significant customer <LINEBREAK> base within the TD AMCB that are mass market clients. We have seen a dramatic increase now in <LINEBREAK> referrals from our stores to our wealth advisers, and we are continuing to scale our advisers in the U.S. <LINEBREAK> and we now have 300 advisers moving to 400 advisers by the end of this year. And what I would tell you <LINEBREAK> is, on a monthly basis we are continuing to see momentum and we suspect, we will continue to drive <LINEBREAK> growth in our U.S. Wealth franchise as we move forward. <LINEBREAK> Sohrab Movahedi - BMO - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Maybe just if we can go to Michael Rhodes and talk about the deposit trends in Canada and what you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expect to happen there first, please? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Michael Rhodes - TD - Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure, absolutely. I'll start, I mean, just as Leo mentioned, clearly, rate sensitivity in the higher rate <LINEBREAK> environment is picking up. That being the case, our strategy has been and continues to be gathering core <LINEBREAK> franchise accounts and think of the chequing account as really the anchor of that. We have seen very <LINEBREAK> strong account acquisition over the past quarter, actually recently, and this is being driven by a record <LINEBREAK> number of New to Canada chequing accounts for Q1. And so we are seeing very strong flows coming in. <LINEBREAK> And the result of that is we are seeing that our non-term share of deposits across the industry is actually <LINEBREAK> increasing at a very nice pace - actually on a year-over-year basis of about 90 basis points of share gain <LINEBREAK> for non-term share of deposits. Now the overall industry that you're seeing some mixed shifts, if we were <LINEBREAK> to look at industry data, I think, what you would actually see is that our mix shift has been much more <LINEBREAK> moderate, and we have been using very disciplined pricing across our depository products and we have <LINEBREAK> been pleased with how this has performed. And when you look at the NIM for Canadian Personal and <LINEBREAK> Commercial Banking, I think, that provides evidence that this is being well managed. <LINEBREAK> Sohrab Movahedi - BMO - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Do you expect the competitive dynamics still allow you to exercise that discipline? Or do you think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> eventually you will have to give into it? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Michael Rhodes - TD - Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, so the competitive dynamic ebbs and flows as you can imagine, week-to-week, month-to-month. <LINEBREAK> And I'd say right now, we have been very disciplined in terms of our pricing and has performed well for us. <LINEBREAK> And I don't see any real changes that are coming in the near term. <LINEBREAK>

Is there going to be any incremental cost <LINEBREAK> associated with that? Or how should we be thinking about that? <LINEBREAK> Kelvin Tran - TD - Chief Financial Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes. We will continue to dynamically roll that forward. And as we've talked about earlier, the biggest <LINEBREAK> hedge on the interest rate is something that we already have on the books and we will continue to role <LINEBREAK> that forward and the cost is minimal. And then we also have the FX hedge as well, and we'll role that <LINEBREAK> forward, too. <LINEBREAK> Sohrab Movahedi - BMO - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So no material, incremental or marginal risk -- or cost, sorry -- associated with it? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Kelvin Tran - TD - Chief Financial Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Right. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sohrab Movahedi - BMO - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And just lastly, I mean, Bharat, last quarter I think when you finished off the year, in your remarks you <LINEBREAK> commented that it could even be that in 2023 the Bank can deliver EPS within its median term growth <LINEBREAK> targets. Do you still expect that to be the case? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So I think last quarter when I said that, we said given the rate momentum and the anticipated <LINEBREAK> closing of the announced acquisitions, those are certainly tailwinds for us, and as well as the volume <LINEBREAK> growth that we have just delivered. There are headwinds, of course. There are geopolitical tensions, it's a <LINEBREAK> complex operating environment and potential economic slowdown. So on balance, I said at that time, <LINEBREAK> unless things change, we should meet that and there was a chance we would exceed it. So we'll see. We <LINEBREAK> are very happy with our first quarter. Organically, the Bank delivered 8% earning growth. So very pleased <LINEBREAK> with that. You saw some of the numbers. And I think folks have talked about some of the loan numbers <LINEBREAK> we are seeing and our ability to attract noninterest rate sensitive deposits, which is a core strength of the <LINEBREAK> Bank and continued momentum on the Wealth and Insurance side. <LINEBREAK> So very happy with how things have started off in the year. Let's see how the next three quarters go. <LINEBREAK> And then we can look back and say, alright, out of the headwinds, which ones came to pass and then out <LINEBREAK> the tailwinds, which ones came to pass and then we can talk about it then. If we have exceeded it even <LINEBREAK> more as to why that happened. And if we haven't met it, then we will explain what caused that. <LINEBREAK> Mike Rizvanovic - KBW - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I want to ask Michael Rhodes, what is your outlook on the RESL book in Canada. What kind of growth is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the cards for 2023? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Michael Rhodes - TD - Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Great question. Clearly you know that the number of sales and purchases of homes in Canada has gone <LINEBREAK> down, and recent data supports that. As we look across 2023, we'd expect that RESL growth to be in the <LINEBREAK> low- to mid-single digits range for the year. <LINEBREAK>

Just looking at your <LINEBREAK> portfolio, looks like it was down a little bit sequentially or let's just call it, flat quarter-over-quarter. And as <LINEBREAK> I look at some of the large cities that have reported the Fed data for sales, it's still down plus 40% year <LINEBREAK> over-year. I'm wondering where would you see that growth coming from? What's baked into that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assessment when you say low to mid-single digit, it seems quite optimistic given the state of the market <LINEBREAK> right now. <LINEBREAK> Michael Rhodes - TD - Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> A couple of things that come into play there. You're right, for the quarter, sequentially, we were <LINEBREAK> basically flat. As you look going forward, there are a couple of things. One is the first quarter, of course, <LINEBREAK> is seasonally a relatively low quarter. The second is as I just look into our pipelines on a go-forward basis, <LINEBREAK> I'm feeling more optimistic about things on a go-forward basis. We see our advisers are being quite <LINEBREAK> productive, and we're making some operational enhancements to our processes. And so the data, I look <LINEBREAK> at, gives me some optimism on a go-forward basis, recognizing the market is soft. And if the market <LINEBREAK> softens up a whole bunch more than I might change my tune, but just given what I see today, I think <LINEBREAK> that's achievable. <LINEBREAK> Mike Rizvanovic - KBW - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay, and Bharat, I just had a really quick follow-up for you on your earlier comment about the 12% CET1 <LINEBREAK> level. I think what you said was the midpoint of 2024. I'm not going to ask you about the First Horizon <LINEBREAK> timing or anything like that. But when you say 12% by middle of next year, is that based on the <LINEBREAK> assumption of TD's normal course, typical environment where you get that 15 to 20 basis points quarter <LINEBREAK> over-quarter sequential organic generation? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes, Mike. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Lemar Persaud - Cormark - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It seems like the Bank is not going to be able to answer most of my questions on First Horizon right <LINEBREAK> now, but maybe I'll try one of them. In the outside chance the deal doesn't get regulatory approval or an <LINEBREAK> agreement to extend isn't achieved, would it be fair to suggest the $435 million termination fee would not <LINEBREAK> apply in this case? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I think the deal terms are in the document that we filed, and Lemar, best for you to check that as to what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the technicalities are there, in that all the details around it. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Lemar Persaud - Cormark - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. And then maybe turning to Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking. Can you talk to what's <LINEBREAK> driving the weaker business deposit growth? It looks like it's a drop for two consecutive quarters. Would it <LINEBREAK> be fair to suggest this is just the deployment of some excess COVID deposits? <LINEBREAK>

Thanks, Lemar. If you look back to the early part of the pandemic, you would see that TD <LINEBREAK> outgrew most of the banks for quite a while in the early part of the pandemic. Some of that is just the <LINEBREAK> reversal of that now that we've ended. And that has to do with the makeup of our book compared to <LINEBREAK> others. And then in addition, as Leo spoke about, there is a seek for yield here going on. We're not losing <LINEBREAK> any accounts. The core business is quite strong. Some of the excess deposits that our Commercial Bank <LINEBREAK> customers hold are chasing yield and our policy has always been to be very disciplined around margins. <LINEBREAK> And so we have lost some deposits. <LINEBREAK> Joo Ho Kim - Credit Suisse Securities - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Just wanted to go back to your net interest margin comment. You had mentioned that it may moderate in <LINEBREAK> terms of improvement from here. And when I look at the results this quarter, you were up 2 basis points <LINEBREAK> sequentially at the all bank level. So I'm curious, is that sort of the improvement that we should think <LINEBREAK> about as we go forward, that maybe 1 to 2 basis points on the low single-digit improvement? Just curious <LINEBREAK> if you could quantify what you see for the remainder of the year? <LINEBREAK> Kelvin Tran - TD - Chief Financial Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's Kelvin. I'll take that. The 2 basis point quarter-over-quarter that you mentioned, it's the all-inclusive <LINEBREAK> NIM. And so we typically look at non-trading NIM, and when you adjust for that, the quarter-over-quarter <LINEBREAK> expansion is a positive 6 basis points. And so last quarter, in Q4, the margin expansion was 12 basis <LINEBREAK> points and then this quarter, 6 basis points, and you expect that to moderate, and we expect that the <LINEBREAK> margin expansion continues to be positive for the remainder of 2023, but the trend is going to be similar, <LINEBREAK> that it is going to be moderating. <LINEBREAK> What I would like to note though is that a lot of people focus only on short-term rates. And as you know, <LINEBREAK> we had a significant increase in short-term rates over the last few quarters. Forwards would indicate that <LINEBREAK> there's still some to come, but less than before. But I would like to note that the long-term rate also <LINEBREAK> matters. So if you look at Page 27, -- in Canada, the relevant rate is 5 years in the U.S. it is 7 years. <LINEBREAK> These tractors do reprice over time. And the on rate is higher than the off rate. And so what that means is <LINEBREAK> that even if short-term rates do not go up, everything else being equal, the repricing of the tractors will <LINEBREAK> continue to support margin expansion. <LINEBREAK> Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The first one I had for you was on your performing credit loss provisions this quarter. I noticed that there <LINEBREAK> was a build in the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking segment, but a reversal in U.S. Retail. <LINEBREAK> Just wondering what drove that because typically, we don't see a divergence in performing PCLs across <LINEBREAK> those segments. <LINEBREAK> Ajai Bambawale - TD - Group Head and Chief Risk Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Nigel, it's Ajai. So let me respond to that. What I would say is you've got to look at these trends over <LINEBREAK> a longer period. But if you actually go and look at the year-over-year numbers, you'll find impaired and <LINEBREAK> performing are up both in Canada and the U.S. You're right in pointing out that this quarter, U.S. <LINEBREAK> performing actually came down. There are really two reasons for that. One is we had repayments of some <LINEBREAK> high-risk loans. So the associated allowance got released. And the second reason is we made a <LINEBREAK> methodology update relating to consumer loans, where we found we were over predicting the move from <LINEBREAK> Stage 1 to Stage 2. So we put that correction in which led to a reversal. So if you exclude these two, you <LINEBREAK> would have actually seen a small performing build in the U.S. as well. <LINEBREAK>

And then the last question I had just quickly was on variable rate mortgages. Any update <LINEBREAK> on the portfolio, how it's tracking? And just a question of the monthly mortgage payment. Just trying to <LINEBREAK> understand if the higher rates leads to an immediate pass-through of an increase in the monthly mortgage <LINEBREAK> payment or if a proportion of it is capitalized and then passed through later on to the trigger point? Just <LINEBREAK> trying to understand the dynamics of how the monthly payments are tracking relative to mortgage rates <LINEBREAK> for variable. <LINEBREAK> Ajai Bambawale - TD - Group Head and Chief Risk Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I can start generally with credit quality, and then I'll pass it on to Michael Rhodes. So what I would tell you <LINEBREAK> is, generally across the RESL book, our credit quality is strong. So if I look at delinquencies, and I see the <LINEBREAK> quarter-over-quarter change, it's nominal. It's basically one bp of that due to HELOC. Formations, RESL <LINEBREAK> is flat; charge-offs, I would say, near zero. <LINEBREAK> So if I look at quality in many different ways, the quality is strong. The books we are watching, we're <LINEBREAK> definitely watching the variable interest rate mortgages, in particular, the trigger point population. We are <LINEBREAK> watching rate renewal risk across both the variable and fixed books as well. But overall, we're seeing <LINEBREAK> strong quality. We're actually seeing customers come forward when they hit the trigger rate. And keep in <LINEBREAK> mind when they hit the trigger rate, there's no requirement to repay us, but we are very encouraged by <LINEBREAK> what we are seeing, where they are voluntarily coming forward and making principal payments. But I'll <LINEBREAK> pass it to Michael for a few minutes. <LINEBREAK> Michael Rhodes - TD - Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ajai, I think you touched a bit about the dynamic of how our variable mortgages work in that as rates go <LINEBREAK> up, that the amount you amortize basically is going down until you could reach a point where you do end <LINEBREAK> up with negative amortization and your loan base has some capital added to it each period. And then <LINEBREAK> either at a trigger point or at renewal, things get reset. <LINEBREAK> Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And just to clarify, I assume that trigger point is 105% of some sort of loan balance amount. Is that how it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> works? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Michael Rhodes - TD - Group Head, Canadian Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It depends if it's a HELOC or if it's a mortgage. For mortgages, it's linked to your loan to value at I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 80%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Nigel D'Souza - Veritas Investment Research - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 80% uninsured, I think it's 105% for insured? Or is it the same for both? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ajai Bambawale - TD - Group Head and Chief Risk Officer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's 105% for the other one. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Darko Mihelic - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Just a quick numbers question for Leo. I'm looking at the U.S. Retail segment and the noninterest income <LINEBREAK> I realize overdraft fees are significantly lower. But when I look at this quarter's number, is it fair to say, <LINEBREAK> Leo, that this is about the bottom? Or is there still some more downside to this line item? <LINEBREAK>

We have fully implemented all the overdraft measures that we identified <LINEBREAK> last year. And so this quarter, you're right to say that you're seeing the full impact of all those changes. <LINEBREAK> And includes the daily limit of overdraft charges, that includes the change in the threshold, which a client <LINEBREAK> begins to incur an overdraft, the 24-hour grace period, the NSF elimination fee, all of those, you've got a <LINEBREAK> full quarter worth of impact. So this is the bottom. I would expect, to your point, as we continue to grow <LINEBREAK> our core checking and cards base that we would see additions to our fee income line. <LINEBREAK> Darko Mihelic - RBC Capital Markets - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Great. That's very helpful. A question for Bharat. You've given us a rough road map to 12% <LINEBREAK> CET 1. There is, of course, a small possibility that the regulator increases the DSB this summer in June. <LINEBREAK> With 50 basis points, let's say, pretend increase, do you have the capability of overcoming a 50 basis <LINEBREAK> point increase in the minimum ratio? Or would you need to raise equity for that? <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have capability to meet that if that turns out to be the case. But these are hypothetical questions, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you asked me a straight question, I gave you a straight answer. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ebrahim Poonawala - BofA Securities - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Just two quick follow-ups. One, Leo just sticking with the U.S. noninterest income, any sense of the <LINEBREAK> impact if there are changes instituted to credit card late charge fees, what that would mean for TD? <LINEBREAK> Leo Salom - TD - President and CEO, TD Bank America's Most Convenient Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes. Thank you very much, Ebrahim. Obviously, the CFPB has come out with some proposed rulings. It's <LINEBREAK> still early. I expect there to be some evolution in terms of what that final proposal is going to look like. So <LINEBREAK> I'd prefer not to speculate at this point in time in terms of the total impact. What I would say is credit card <LINEBREAK> late fees as a percent of our total U.S. Retail revenues is a relatively small percentage. So in any event, it <LINEBREAK> would be manageable. <LINEBREAK> Ebrahim Poonawala - BofA Securities - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's helpful. And just one quick one, Riaz for you. We've seen a significant growth in the loan book in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Wholesale Banking. Do you expect that to be sustainable? What's the driver of that? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Riaz Ahmed - TD - Group Head, Wholesale Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, Ebrahim as you know, over the course of the last four or five quarters, there's been a lot of loan <LINEBREAK> demand, and we are in a fortunate position of being able to be particularly selective and grow our client <LINEBREAK> base, particularly in the United States in accordance consistently with our strategy. And we're earning <LINEBREAK> very good returns on those new originations. So it's really about taking market share at a time when we're <LINEBREAK> able to. <LINEBREAK> Ebrahim Poonawala - BofA Securities - Analyst <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And just on market share, Riaz. It's a difficult period for a bunch of investment banks right now. Is there <LINEBREAK> a strategy to grow up and beyond their existing verticals and selectively hire bankers and capabilities and <LINEBREAK> maybe be aggressive on that over the next 12 months or so? <LINEBREAK>

But I think that for the next let's say, quarter or two, the focus will be on getting the integration <LINEBREAK> correct and finished. <LINEBREAK> Operator <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> There are no further questions registered at this time. I would like to return the call back to Mr. Bharat <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Masrani. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bharat Masrani - TD - Group President and CEO <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks so much. Thanks very much, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. <LINEBREAK> Again, a great quarter from TD, terrific, 8% earnings growth, $4.2 billion in earnings. So very happy with <LINEBREAK> the start to the year. And once again, I want to take this opportunity to thank our TD bankers around the <LINEBREAK> world for once again delivering for all of our stakeholders. <LINEBREAK> And Paul, congratulations again, 47 great years at the Bank, and it's a good thing you're not going away <LINEBREAK> far. So we look forward to working with you in your other capacities at the Bank. And Barb, <LINEBREAK> congratulations on your new position with the Canadian Commercial Bank.
