Today's call will be hosted by Jenn Landis, <LINEBREAK> Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal <LINEBREAK> remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a <LINEBREAK> reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this <LINEBREAK> time. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ms. Landis, you may begin. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JENNIFER LANDIS: </BOLD> Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you <LINEBREAK> that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain <LINEBREAK> forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to <LINEBREAK> uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due <LINEBREAK> to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that, I'll turn it over to Jane. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> Thank you, Jenn, hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another <LINEBREAK> interesting year, given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks. I am going to share some observations, <LINEBREAK> and then we'll turn to what was a good quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges <LINEBREAK> to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as <LINEBREAK> someone who has worked in many different systems around the world. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and global banks including <LINEBREAK> Citi. <MULTISPACE> We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on <LINEBREAK> different scales. <MULTISPACE> I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that <LINEBREAK> helped reinforce confidence in the system at a critical juncture. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our <LINEBREAK> clients. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are in a position to play this role because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. <MULTISPACE> We <LINEBREAK> benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance <LINEBREAK> sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how <LINEBREAK> we run the firm, from client selection to capital planning. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And it is also thanks to our people. I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who have <LINEBREAK> worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turned to Citi as a port in the storm. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While <LINEBREAK>

We have highly-liquid investment <LINEBREAK> securities and a significant amount of cash. <MULTISPACE> We have over $1 trillion of available liquidity resources, including <LINEBREAK> $584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. <MULTISPACE> And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over <LINEBREAK> $1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries, and regions, many of which are operational <LINEBREAK> in nature. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these <LINEBREAK> deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our <LINEBREAK> multinational clients run their businesses around the world <LINEBREAK> from their payrolls to their supply chains to <LINEBREAK> their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our <LINEBREAK> integrated services- payments & collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients <LINEBREAK> manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. <MULTISPACE> This greatly increases our deposit stickiness. <MULTISPACE> And that is also <LINEBREAK> why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Finally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both asset and liability concentrations across client <LINEBREAK> segment, industry, and region, and we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures given our <LINEBREAK> rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the <LINEBREAK> interconnectedness of financial institutions. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> which is particularly relevant given <LINEBREAK> the degree of uncertainty today. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services, even <LINEBREAK> as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. <MULTISPACE> We expect the recent events to be disinflationary and <LINEBREAK> credit to contract. <MULTISPACE> We believe it is now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this <LINEBREAK> biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term US interest rates and, of course, how the debt ceiling <LINEBREAK> plays out. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Europe, the ECB is on a similar, but more difficult, quest to tame inflation. They have had some help from <LINEBREAK> lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in <LINEBREAK> Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending and Europe faces more structural challenges such as the need for <LINEBREAK> increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen <LINEBREAK> inflation and stimulate growth more difficult. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region although the Chinese consumer has <LINEBREAK> been slower to rebound than expected. <MULTISPACE> I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our <LINEBREAK> bankers in my various trips to India, Japan, and Hong Kong this year. <MULTISPACE> We have to keep a close eye on <LINEBREAK> geopolitics as the US-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocs. <LINEBREAK> We see this translate into shifts in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global <LINEBREAK> network. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex-divestitures and both revenue and expenses were in line <LINEBREAK> with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefitted from the closing of the sales of our consumer <LINEBREAK> businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<BOLD>T RANSCRIP T</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Citi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD>April 14, 2023 </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD> </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 3 <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let me highlight our operating performance in each of our five core businesses. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Services, TTS continued to go from strength to strength, with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was <LINEBREAK> up 11% quarter-on-quarter-on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in <LINEBREAK> commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. <MULTISPACE> Securities Servic <LINEBREAK> 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefitted from higher rates. <LINEBREAK> Within Markets, our Fixed Income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefitted from excellent <LINEBREAK> performance in Rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was <LINEBREAK> no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third-best in a decade. Equities was weaker however - <LINEBREAK> down markedly in both derivatives and cash, but still had revenues north of $1 billion. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Banking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a rebound, including increased activity in <LINEBREAK> the investment grade debt market. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In US Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continue to normalize to pre- <LINEBREAK> COVID levels. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24% respectively. Retail Banking <LINEBREAK> saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also <LINEBREAK> experienced a significant increase in digital deposits. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and <LINEBREAK> entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories <LINEBREAK> were down. <MULTISPACE> Savings rates are below historic averages. While the upper quintiles of household income still <LINEBREAK> have roughly a trillion dollars in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly <LINEBREAK> drawn down. So we are keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services <LINEBREAK> spend slow. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Finally, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging <LINEBREAK> headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisors were all solid and we expect <LINEBREAK> these drivers to flow through to revenue later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long- <LINEBREAK> awaited Asian recovery. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro- <LINEBREAK> outlooks. NCLs continued to normalize in Consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in <LINEBREAK> another quarter of very low NCLs. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Finally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have <LINEBREAK> room to absorb the temporary, upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue <LINEBREAK> to pursue a dual path here. And we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our <LINEBREAK> shareholders over time. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As you can see from slide three, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and, despite <LINEBREAK> everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy that we <LINEBREAK> shared with you at Investor Day. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the <LINEBREAK> list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our <LINEBREAK> efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We made some significant leadership announcements. I am delighted that Andy Sieg will join Citi at my table <LINEBREAK> as the new head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us <LINEBREAK> after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible <LINEBREAK> example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years. <LINEBREAK>

Anand has <LINEBREAK> been at Citi for over three decades and has a strong track record of delivering results. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of our Transformation, we are completely focused on executing our plans to address the consent <LINEBREAK> orders and improve our risk and control environment. <MULTISPACE> Mark will walk you through specific examples of how <LINEBREAK> we are modernizing our infrastructure, simplifying processes, and improving data quality. <MULTISPACE> Importantly, these <LINEBREAK> efforts will impr <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> relentless focus on delivering. <MULTISPACE> Our strategy is clear. Our business model is resilient and diversified. <MULTISPACE> Our <LINEBREAK> balance sheet is strong. <MULTISPACE> We are making good progress on execution. Amidst considerable turmoil, we are <LINEBREAK> delivering on our guidance and our commitments. Our team is determined to continue delivering with <LINEBREAK> excellence. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted, as always, to take your <LINEBREAK> questions. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the Firmwide <LINEBREAK> financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I indicate otherwise, <LINEBREAK> and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital. Then I will turn to the results of <LINEBREAK> each segment. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of <LINEBREAK> approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and a RoTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. <LINEBREAK> Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely <LINEBREAK> driven by the gain on sale of the India consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86 with an <LINEBREAK> RoTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6% <LINEBREAK> excluding divestiture-related impacts as strength across Services, Fixed Income and .S Personal Banking <LINEBREAK> was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth, as well as the revenue <LINEBREAK> reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divesture- <LINEBREAK> related costs in the prior year, expenses increased by 5% largely driven by the transformation, other risk & <LINEBREAK> control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from <LINEBREAK> the exits and wind-downs. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Cost of credit was approximately $2.0 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in Card net <LINEBREAK> credit losses and ACL and other provision builds of approximately $700 million, largely related to a <LINEBREAK> deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balances. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loans ratio of <LINEBREAK> approximately 2.7%. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter, with the key underlying drivers. Transformation <LINEBREAK> investments drove ~1% of the growth largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of <LINEBREAK> the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits including the full-year <LINEBREAK> impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Embedded in this structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are <LINEBREAK> enterprise wide and in the businesses make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact <LINEBREAK>

Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset <LINEBREAK> by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction <LINEBREAK> from the exits and across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to <LINEBREAK> modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> investing in and the benefits we will see over time. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring <LINEBREAK> and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to one single modern platform, eliminating costs over time. <LINEBREAK> And we have consolidated 11 platforms to one global sanctions-screening platform, reducing false alerts, <LINEBREAK> improving the client experience and eliminating costs. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cyber <LINEBREAK> security through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer <LINEBREAK> operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and <LINEBREAK> streamline the connectivity between our front office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual <LINEBREAK> processes and operating costs over time. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are driving the strategy by investing in the client experience both in terms of our technology interface <LINEBREAK> and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for eCommerce <LINEBREAK> clients in TTS. We are also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for <LINEBREAK> Commercial clients so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the <LINEBREAK> same way our Large Corporate clients do. And finally, we are investing in data to create advanced decision <LINEBREAK> making, client targeting, and risk management capabilities which has allowed us to enhance our returns <LINEBREAK> through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will <LINEBREAK> allow us to self-fund future investments over time. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning <LINEBREAK> balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. <LINEBREAK> Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG. And our net interest margin <LINEBREAK> increased 2 basis points. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current <LINEBREAK> environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves-to-funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%. <LINEBREAK> And within that, US Cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards and of that <LINEBREAK> exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and <LINEBREAK> are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely <LINEBREAK> in Wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, <LINEBREAK> approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment <LINEBREAK> grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain <LINEBREAK> low at about 40 basis points of total loans. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As you can see on the page, we break out our Commercial Real Estate lending exposures across ICG and <LINEBREAK> PBWM which total $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical <LINEBREAK> environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels <LINEBREAK> and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. <LINEBREAK>

<BOLD>T RANSCRIP T</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Citi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD>April 14, 2023 </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD> </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 6 <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet. <LINEBREAK> We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 <LINEBREAK> trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types which is deployed into high- <LINEBREAK> quality, diversified assets. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well diversified business model. <MULTISPACE> We leverage our unique <LINEBREAK> assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global <LINEBREAK> needs. <MULTISPACE> First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion, are institutional, and span 90 countries. And the <LINEBREAK> majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> so when rates go up, we reprice <LINEBREAK> the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the <LINEBREAK> level of rates. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational <LINEBREAK> services we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of US Retail <LINEBREAK> consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits <LINEBREAK> are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions <LINEBREAK> and products, with 75% of US Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having <LINEBREAK> been with Citi for more than 10 years. <MULTISPACE> Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this <LINEBREAK> usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding investment and deposit products. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now turning to the asset side, at a high-level, you can think about our deposits being largely deployed in <LINEBREAK> three asset buckets <LINEBREAK> loans, investment securities and cash <LINEBREAK> which complement the interest rate <LINEBREAK> sensitivity and liquidity value of our liabilities. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> we use <LINEBREAK> our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns <LINEBREAK> for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of <LINEBREAK> the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable-rate. About 35% of <LINEBREAK> our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities which contribute to our $1 trillion of available <LINEBREAK> liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly <LINEBREAK> $100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. <MULTISPACE> And you can <LINEBREAK> see the details of this on page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the <LINEBREAK> composition and duration of that liquidity. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid US Treasury, Agency and other <LINEBREAK> sovereign bonds, and is split evenly between available-for-sale and held-to- <LINEBREAK> maintained a short duration of less than three years so we could benefit from higher interest rates. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress <LINEBREAK> scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risk, liquidity, and capital. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and <LINEBREAK> duration, and reflect the diversified business model and execution of our strategy. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from <LINEBREAK> the end of fourth quarter. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common which added 38 basis <LINEBREAK> points. <MULTISPACE> Second, we returned $1.0 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about <LINEBREAK> 9 basis points. Third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase. <LINEBREAK> And finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our <LINEBREAK> consumer exits. <LINEBREAK>

Revenues were up <LINEBREAK> 1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and <LINEBREAK> Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and <LINEBREAK> volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit, as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted <LINEBREAK> in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23%, driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues, <LINEBREAK> partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% RoTCE for the quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And average loans were down 2% reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits <LINEBREAK> were up 3% as we continued to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And <LINEBREAK> sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end of period basis, ICG deposits were down 3% <LINEBREAK> sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In <LINEBREAK> Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% <LINEBREAK> in NIR, with growth across all client segments. <MULTISPACE> We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that <LINEBREAK> indicate consistently strong client activity with US Dollar Clearing Volumes up 6%, reflecting continued <LINEBREAK> SWIFT share gains. Cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth. Commercial card volumes <LINEBREAK> up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the <LINEBREAK> remaining 40%, as we continued to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. <MULTISPACE> In fact, <LINEBREAK> client wins are up approximately 50%, across all segments. <MULTISPACE> These include marquee transactions where we <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates <LINEBREAK> across currencies, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market <LINEBREAK> valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets <LINEBREAK> under custody and administration from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of <LINEBREAK> new deals. As a reminder, the Services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher- <LINEBREAK> returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in Fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income <LINEBREAK> revenues were up 4%, relative to a very strong quarter last year, as strength in our Rates franchise was <LINEBREAK> partially offset by a decline in FX and Commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a <LINEBREAK> strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in Cash and Equity Derivatives. <LINEBREAK> Corporate client flows remained strong and stable and we continued to make solid progress on our <LINEBREAK> revenue-to-RWA target <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by <LINEBREAK> Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. <LINEBREAK> Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially largely driven by the investment grade market <LINEBREAK> opening up. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

Average deposits <LINEBREAK> decreased 3%, largely reflecting our Wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our <LINEBREAK> platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded <LINEBREAK> Cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. <MULTISPACE> We continue to see strong underlying <LINEBREAK> drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%, card spend volumes up 9% and average loans up 15%. <MULTISPACE> Retail <LINEBREAK> Services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> For both Card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline, and that combined with the <LINEBREAK> investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in Branded <LINEBREAK> Cards and 11% in Retail Services. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Retail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in <LINEBREAK> personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the <LINEBREAK> associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continued to leverage <LINEBREAK> our retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs <LINEBREAK> particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia which were <LINEBREAK> up approximately 20% on a sequential basis. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Client advisors were up 3%. And we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client <LINEBREAK> acquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62% <LINEBREAK> and 81%, respectively. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we are seeing strong underlying <LINEBREAK> business drivers as we execute against our strategy. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 15, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on the sale of our <LINEBREAK> consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. Expenses <LINEBREAK> decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as <LINEBREAK> the impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by <LINEBREAK> higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. <MULTISPACE> Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other <LINEBREAK> risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

Despite recent events and the economic <LINEBREAK> uncertainty that remains, our full-year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources with ample capital <LINEBREAK> and liquidity, which positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios. We are seeing <LINEBREAK> solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our <LINEBREAK> strategy. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a <LINEBREAK> variety of scenarios. <LINEBREAK> help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>QUESTION AND ANSWER </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>GLENN SCHORR: </BOLD> Hi, thank you, a simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first <LINEBREAK> quarter NII and revenue production was great, and if you just annualize it, you're handily ahead of your full <LINEBREAK> year guide. So I'm just curious on how you're thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of <LINEBREAK> schedule. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very <LINEBREAK> solid first quarter, but as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still <LINEBREAK> out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we <LINEBREAK> contemplate the direction of rates and what's required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that <LINEBREAK> we've seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And so when I think about that and I think about how frankly betas have evolved and the likelihood of a <LINEBREAK> recession in the back half of the year, which we have built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the <LINEBREAK> guidance that we've set here. And when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the <LINEBREAK> strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening <LINEBREAK> relationships with new and existing clients, the Card momentum, which is really about seeing more <LINEBREAK> revolving activity as payment rates start to slow, and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not <LINEBREAK> as swift as we would like and so we have to see how that plays out too. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So when I put those things together, there's certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification <LINEBREAK> of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I'm comfortable with the guidance that we've set, <LINEBREAK> and if that changes, we'll certainly update you, but that's where we are. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>GLENN SCHORR: </BOLD> I appreciate that. Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments, the previous ones on TTS <LINEBREAK> and Securities Services. I try to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them, but in 2008 we thought <LINEBREAK> housing prices couldn't go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt. The same thing in <LINEBREAK> March, thought deposits couldn't leave a bank so quickly, but they did. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they're great and they show the stability of your deposit <LINEBREAK> franchise, but I'm curious if history can change at all. Meaning right now, those are cash and operating <LINEBREAK> deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you're fully integrated, but do you have client <LINEBREAK> concentrations we should know about or are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms <LINEBREAK> of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know it's a tough one. <LINEBREAK>

I feel very comfortable about how very well- <LINEBREAK> diversified our deposit base is across different countries, industries, clients, and currencies. It's extremely <LINEBREAK> strong in that respect, and as you say, the majority of the Institutional deposits are integrated into the <LINEBREAK> operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the <LINEBREAK> payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, et cetera. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And I think what's changed in the more digital world is frankly these have become even stickier because the <LINEBREAK> amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the <LINEBREAK> value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX trade, cash, et cetera, <LINEBREAK> flows, is incredibly important in driving their efficiency, their risk management, and their financial <LINEBREAK> performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history <LINEBREAK> is something that we're certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see from the pages we've put <LINEBREAK> into the deck as well including in the back on just the consistency of this base. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Mark, what would you add? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> I think that's exactly right, Jane, and Glenn, I'm glad you pointed out pages 25 and 26 which <LINEBREAK> clearly lay out that diversification but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period <LINEBREAK> of time. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The only thing I'd add additional to that would be obviously we're in an environment where there's <LINEBREAK> quantitative tightening that's occurring. That's going to have a broad industry impact as we've started to <LINEBREAK> see already, but we're also in an environment where rates are increasing. We'll see how that plays out <LINEBREAK> through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn't mistake price-sensitivity or <LINEBREAK> interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we've obviously talked about betas <LINEBREAK> increasing particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the US. It obviously will continue to increase outside <LINEBREAK> of the US, but we'll work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that <LINEBREAK> we bring to influence and impact pricing, and more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, <LINEBREAK> we do see them as very stable. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is <LINEBREAK> open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MIKE MAYO: </BOLD> Hi, Jane, I challenged you a couple earnings calls ago about the complexity created by being in <LINEBREAK> so many countries, and you said TTS was your crown jewel, and here it's up almost one-third year-over-year, <LINEBREAK> so, so far so good since your Investor Day. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Can you talk about for the fee growth? I mean, we kind of understand the NII growth, but the fee growth is <LINEBREAK> double-digits also, so I guess that's money in motion and I think you described this as the world's largest <LINEBREAK> wholesale global payments system. What's happening to give you double-digit top line growth there? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> Oh, thank you, Mike, and a great question. I think one of the numbers I'm almost more happy <LINEBREAK> about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here because obviously, <LINEBREAK> we've been benefiting in TTS from the rates environment but we've also been benefiting from the drivers <LINEBREAK> behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different <LINEBREAK> offerings that we have here, and we're typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee <LINEBREAK> revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around <LINEBREAK> the world are making a big difference to the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these <LINEBREAK>

<BOLD>T RANSCRIP T</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Citi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD>April 14, 2023 </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD> </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 11 <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> areas. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MIKE MAYO: </BOLD> Okay. And then as it relates to rates generally, what is it, like, over 90% of your rate sensitivity <LINEBREAK> is outside the US, and so shouldn't you be benefiting more than you originally thought given some of these <LINEBREAK> rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties and the IB backlog <LINEBREAK> pushed out, and, no I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over and I'm just wondering if <LINEBREAK> you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, so again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move <LINEBREAK> and capturing NII as you pointed out outside of the US. We articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel <LINEBREAK> shift and that mix at the end of last year was the 90/10 that you mentioned for non-US. As I sit here in <LINEBREAK> March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-US and a little bit more towards the US, and you'll <LINEBREAK> see that in the 10-Q. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that said, I mentioned earlier, there's still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve <LINEBREAK> here in the US. We'll see how betas evolve. We've reached terminal betas in the US with our clients kind of <LINEBREAK> at the end of last year, and so we'll see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of <LINEBREAK> 2023. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the US, and so we'll see the pacing of that, again, in light of <LINEBREAK> how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly in light of how we've seen the broader sector turmoil <LINEBREAK> play out. That could in fact play to our benefit. But we are also, again, in an environment where there's <LINEBREAK> quantitative tightening that is still at play. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then the final point I'd make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is Legacy NII, and so as <LINEBREAK> we continue with our wind-downs, our divestitures, et cetera, that's going to be a headwind that we will <LINEBREAK> have to deal with. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is <LINEBREAK> open. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>BETSY GRASECK: </BOLD> Hi, good morning. I know during the prepared remarks you talked a bit about Andy Sieg <LINEBREAK> coming on board, and I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you're doing <LINEBREAK> with Wealth, not only in the US but the non-US locations, and also try to understand how much capital you <LINEBREAK> think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today. Thanks. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> Hey there Betsy. So, we're obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head <LINEBREAK> of Wealth around my table, and he's a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He's got <LINEBREAK> deep product and digital expertise; a proven people leader and we'll certainly be taking full advantage of his <LINEBREAK> expertise and experience in the US. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We're not shifting our strategy in Wealth. His mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investor <LINEBREAK> Day. We see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum <LINEBREAK> there. We'll be scaling up in the US by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our <LINEBREAK> existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank <LINEBREAK> and the family office franchise really around the world, and there's a lot of synergies to be realized as we <LINEBREAK> point out in the different KPIs and drivers between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and <LINEBREAK> other business that we're able to generate across the franchise. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on board. Mark, what else would you add <LINEBREAK> in? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

When you look at kind of the client advisors, as you know, we've been investing in <LINEBREAK> bringing on new client advisors. We've been increasing the number of new clients that we've been <LINEBREAK> onboarding as well. We've invested in some of the investment products that we have, and so I feel like we <LINEBREAK> are positioning ourselves for when this turns. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this in a normal cycle is a very healthy returning <LINEBREAK> business, and as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the <LINEBREAK> growth and return prospects that we see in front of us. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses, and so I think you've got to keep <LINEBREAK> both of those things in mind. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>ERIKA NAJARIAN: </BOLD> Hi. Good morning. And I think it's remarkable that your first two questions were <LINEBREAK> essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative, so that's very notable for a Citi call. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody were certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg <LINEBREAK> hire, and clearly, he was running a much larger business than what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky <LINEBREAK> question. Clearly, you're still working through some of the transformation. There's still a consent order, but <LINEBREAK> given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could <LINEBREAK> be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your <LINEBREAK> Wealth Management footprint more quickly? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential, and I think that's really where we're <LINEBREAK> going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office, there is so much wealth <LINEBREAK> creation supplemented by our Commercial Banking relationships with a lot of the enterprises and the owners <LINEBREAK> of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we're <LINEBREAK> extremely well-positioned to capture that. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I don't see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don't have our own <LINEBREAK> proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products. We're an open architecture, and <LINEBREAK> therefore, we're a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the Institutional side of the business <LINEBREAK> to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients <LINEBREAK> around the world. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that that <LINEBREAK> are of interest. So I'll never say never in the longer-run. I'm sure if something very attractive comes up, we'll be <LINEBREAK> very interested and looking at it, but it's not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we're <LINEBREAK> focused. Actually almost independent of the consent orders, I think what we're looking at doing right now is <LINEBREAK> getting this organic play right and then we'll see from there. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> 00 referrals from our Retail Bank to the Wealth space or to <LINEBREAK> our Wealth business, and there's a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model <LINEBREAK> that we've been talking about. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> And I think the other bit I'd also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that <LINEBREAK> we aren't constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth, so part of <LINEBREAK> the mandate for Andy and the ones that we've been working on to date is really looking at what is modern <LINEBREAK> Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well-positioned that way, because I do think that will <LINEBREAK> be more of the way of the future. <LINEBREAK>

Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JIM MITCHELL: </BOLD> Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. Appreciate the fact that the potential <LINEBREAK> sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you're sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion <LINEBREAK> now above your target. Obviously your expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an <LINEBREAK> offset, so how do we think about, how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your <LINEBREAK> stock as cheap as it is? <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good morning. As you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this <LINEBREAK> quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis <LINEBREAK> points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that, was really net income earnings <LINEBREAK> generation, which is important. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Look, the way we think about it is that 13.4%, we certainly have well-above what's required from a regulatory <LINEBREAK> point of view and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we've said in <LINEBREAK> the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction and that would be a temporary drag to CET1 at signing, the <LINEBREAK> difference between signing and closing if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other <LINEBREAK> factors that are out there as well. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So think about the Basel III end game that's out there and the capital requirements that could come out of <LINEBREAK> that. Think about the CCAR DFAST that has been submitted and currently under review, and what that might <LINEBREAK> mean for stress capital buffers, and also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader <LINEBREAK> global macro environment that we're playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I <LINEBREAK> think about all of those factors, we're in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter, but I'd <LINEBREAK> end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we're trading, all things being equal, <LINEBREAK> we'd like to be buying back shares, but we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> I think we'll have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors, so we'll be able to <LINEBREAK> give you better clarity on timing before too long. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JIM MITCHELL: </BOLD> Yeah, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just, you mentioned increased macro <LINEBREAK> assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> So in terms of the reserve, again, remember we have a couple of different scenarios that we <LINEBREAK> run when we calculate the CECL reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic <LINEBREAK> scenarios. It reflects a 5.1% or so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters, so that's <LINEBREAK> relatively flat versus last quarter. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit <LINEBREAK> more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, in light of the macro <LINEBREAK> environment and the combination of that as well as some normalization in the portfolio including an increase <LINEBREAK> in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.1% for the weighted basis over the eight quarters. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>STEVEN CHUBAK: </BOLD> Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB and trading <LINEBREAK> outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of bad <LINEBREAK> volatility and are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the <LINEBREAK> Investment Banking side, I wanted to see if there's any evidence of green shoots. It's been a challenging <LINEBREAK>

Look, we saw better performance in <LINEBREAK> the quarter in Markets than when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really that played <LINEBREAK> through in our Fixed Income business which was up about 4% year-over-year driven largely by strength in <LINEBREAK> Rates and we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter and we were well-positioned to take <LINEBREAK> advantage of that and serve clients and that aided getting us to down 4% in aggregate across Markets. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance, and I still think that based on <LINEBREAK> what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve that we'll be able to deliver on that. <LINEBREAK> But as you know, volatility in many instances plays to the favor of Markets businesses, and so there's a bit <LINEBREAK> of an unknown as to how that evolves. But I feel confident in the guidance that we've given thus far on that. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> Yeah, I'd jump in before you turn to Banking as well. I think one of the differences with our <LINEBREAK> franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporates, and that provides a highly <LINEBREAK> attractive but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we've been seeing is from <LINEBREAK> our perspective very good volatility because we're able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity <LINEBREAK> hedging, and it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors particularly in volatile <LINEBREAK> markets like this. We're not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of <LINEBREAK> the global network. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The other piece that I think is important in the mix here too is just the partnership with TTS, cross-border <LINEBREAK> payments, these other elements and cornerstone of the FX franchise, so there's some pieces here of the <LINEBREAK> volatility that one doesn't usually think of this as being so client-heavy, but that's what's differentiating on <LINEBREAK> the Citi franchise. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Mark, back to you. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> No, thank you, I think that's exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in <LINEBREAK> Investment Banking, obviously the wallets were down meaningfully last year. We saw some good <LINEBREAK> performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw <LINEBREAK> activity in the investment grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure, and I think there was a <LINEBREAK> bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates, and so we'll see how that continues to <LINEBREAK> evolve and play out. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The other thing I'd add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through <LINEBREAK> the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like, and at some point, it's clear <LINEBREAK> that clients are going to need to get back into the markets, but that trajectory is going to largely depend on <LINEBREAK> the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>STEVEN CHUBAK: </BOLD> That's great. And for my follow-up, just on PBWM fee income trends, I'm not going to ask <LINEBREAK> you about the broader Wealth strategy, but we're big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing <LINEBREAK> I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a <LINEBREAK> function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize, and how we should be <LINEBREAK> thinking about the trajectory in fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year? <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees, and I <LINEBREAK> think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the Cards business as well as the Wealth business, <LINEBREAK> and a good amount of the pressure that we've seen in fees and that is still subject to how the environment <LINEBREAK>

So I think <LINEBREAK> that's a big part of the drag in fees. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The upside that we've seen in fees in Banking and Cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and <LINEBREAK> volume evolves across our Cards business. We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales <LINEBREAK> while they're up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter, the growth has <LINEBREAK> been slowing, and has been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment. So we'll have to see how some <LINEBREAK> of that volume activity evolves, and that'll be a factor to keep in mind. <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your <LINEBREAK> line is open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>EBRAHIM POONAWALA: </BOLD> Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. One, in terms of the <LINEBREAK> Banamex sale, I think, Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still <LINEBREAK> are pursuing the dual track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the <LINEBREAK> accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if given just the time it might take to go <LINEBREAK> through an IPO. And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continue to be robust. Is that impacting <LINEBREAK> or influencing how you're thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction? <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> So, we're in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico, so neither Mark nor I are going to <LINEBREAK> comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we're continuing to pursue a dual path, both a sale and an IPO, <LINEBREAK> so we'll have an exit strategy either way, and we'll take the path that is in the best interest of our <LINEBREAK> shareholders. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So we've got an enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the Institutional business. I'm <LINEBREAK> pleased with the progress they're making. I think we're seeing, when we look at the performance of our <LINEBREAK> Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is <LINEBREAK> such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world, and its location is <LINEBREAK> obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the US as well. So I think a lot of the dynamic and the big <LINEBREAK> benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we're keeping within Citi as a core part of our <LINEBREAK> business. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So the current Mexican economy doesn't really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making. <LINEBREAK> The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, and just to put some numbers to that, for the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue <LINEBREAK> year-over-year. Quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well I would say. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane's exactly right. Everything we're doing is positioning us <LINEBREAK> for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we'll choose the path that's best for shareholders. An IPO would <LINEBREAK> take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, et cetera. I would <LINEBREAK> say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is <LINEBREAK> different for an IPO so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L in an IPO. We wouldn't have at <LINEBREAK> signing that impact that is different from that closing and so that would not be an issue. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time, so a lot of moving pieces there. We <LINEBREAK> would need to figure out if we ended up down that path, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the <LINEBREAK> scenarios there. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> But I'd end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose <LINEBREAK>

Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is <LINEBREAK> open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>: </BOLD> Hello. You guys have talked about bending the curve on costs I think in the latter part of <LINEBREAK> 2024, and I wanted to see if that's still the case. And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending <LINEBREAK> the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth, absolute drop, any kind of clarity on that, and costs in <LINEBREAK> general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Thank, Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to <LINEBREAK> bend the curve, as I mentioned, towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in <LINEBREAK> expenses. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> Okay. That's helpful. And then, I think in the past you've kind of insinuated that's like <LINEBREAK> the start of hopefully a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously this is far away, but just any <LINEBREAK> additional color there too. Thank you. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right? We recognize <LINEBREAK> that expenses have been growing. They've been growing because we've been investing in the franchise both <LINEBREAK> transformation-wise as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have <LINEBREAK> in many of our franchises, but we're managing that very actively and very deliberately, and that means that <LINEBREAK> we're looking to ensure that we're spending the money in the right way in the right places and that we're <LINEBREAK> going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that <LINEBREAK> we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term, and what that requires is that we start bending the curve <LINEBREAK> in 2024 as I stated and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency <LINEBREAK> of about 60% and we're positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the <LINEBREAK> divestitures that we've been talking about, right. The second is the benefits from the transformation and <LINEBREAK> other investments that I've just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management <LINEBREAK> simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we're exiting 14 consumer <LINEBREAK> countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important to ensure that we get to that lower <LINEBREAK> cost structure and that we're able to deliver on the broader commitments that we're making with regards <LINEBREAK> to returns. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. <BOLD> </BOLD> Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line <LINEBREAK> is open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>GERARD CASSIDY: </BOLD> Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. A couple questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, <LINEBREAK> or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the disruptions we've seen in the banking system in the <LINEBREAK> month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the US and obviously the large <LINEBREAK> investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming <LINEBREAK> in terms of regulatory whether it's more capital, more liquidity, and it may not be directed at a company like <LINEBREAK> yours because you're a global SIFI already and it might be more regionally orientated in the United States. <LINEBREAK> And as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made <LINEBREAK> into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> Sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I'd say that we hope that there will be a <LINEBREAK> thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework and that they <LINEBREAK>

We still believe that there is plenty of <LINEBREAK> capital amongst the large banks, and if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the <LINEBREAK> regulators it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity <LINEBREAK> in the shadow banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections <LINEBREAK> for participants, and I, amongst others, fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital <LINEBREAK> requirements increase, will be to the detriment of system strength and stability. So we hope that this <LINEBREAK> approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators both at the local and national and the <LINEBREAK> international level were swift and effective in making sure that they tackled the issues that were in front <LINEBREAK> and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And let's just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest US <LINEBREAK> banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in a little over one day, <LINEBREAK> and that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions, and I think the responsibility of large <LINEBREAK> institutions in recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. <LINEBREAK> We thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall <LINEBREAK> US banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>GERARD CASSIDY: </BOLD> No, very, very insightful. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I <LINEBREAK> noticed in your Card, I think it was slide 8, you give us the prime, 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO <LINEBREAK> scores greater than 680. I don't know if you would agree with this statement, but we're hearing that there <LINEBREAK> was some FICO score inflation as a result of the pandemic. A lot of consumers saw their FICO scores go up, <LINEBREAK> and I've seen numbers as high as 70 points, that may be on the high side, but can you guys, do you agree <LINEBREAK> with that, and if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like <LINEBREAK> a 650 score customer? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> I think what's really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we're seeing in the way of the <LINEBREAK> performance of the portfolio. So again, I've heard that sentiment regarding FICO score inflation. We feel very <LINEBREAK> confident in how we've assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime <LINEBREAK> and greater than 680. I think importantly, what we're seeing is we're seeing payment rates start to slow. <LINEBREAK> We're seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We're seeing NCL rates increase, but <LINEBREAK> particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio which is where you would expect <LINEBREAK> to start to see that drag occur, and the NCL rates that we're seeing are still well below what we would see <LINEBREAK> in a normal cycle and they're in line with what we've been forecasting for performance. So there are no <LINEBREAK> surprises that we're seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We'd expect that it will get back to those <LINEBREAK> normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before <LINEBREAK> tapering. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio, and how it reacts to the environment <LINEBREAK> enough to forecast that out, and so far, that's been performing in line with that forecast and those <LINEBREAK> estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we're not missing anything and <LINEBREAK> importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion. <LINEBREAK>

There's a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that, <LINEBREAK> and that's also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence is it's not just prior history, <LINEBREAK> it's a wealth of data that is used. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>VIVEK JUNEJA: <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark and Jane. Mark, I want to go to your <LINEBREAK> revenue, I hear you, you're keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption, <LINEBREAK> just want to unpeel that onion a little bit. What's in your revenue assumption for rates, US and <LINEBREAK> internationally, and what is going on with deposit betas particularly following the inflows you've seen <LINEBREAK> recently in the US with the crisis? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, so, I guess a couple things. One, in terms of the rates that we've assumed, in the <LINEBREAK> balance of the year, we've kind of assumed that rates would flatten out after this quarter, after this second <LINEBREAK> quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year. Down a bit to something like 4.50% or so, so <LINEBREAK> we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 4.50%. That could change, but candidly, <LINEBREAK> if it changes a little bit here or there, it's unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That's likely to have <LINEBREAK> more of an impact in 2024. So we can debate that curve, but that's kind of what we have thus far in our <LINEBREAK> outlook. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The second point I'd make is around non-US rates. We're assuming, I don't have specifics in front of me in <LINEBREAK> terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming continued rate increases there. Not of a <LINEBREAK> significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we're talking about. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the US, but <LINEBREAK> again, they run lower than the US in general for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the <LINEBREAK> PBWM Retail Banking, or the PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either <LINEBREAK> higher-yielding deposit products or investment products, and so we've factored those things into how we <LINEBREAK> think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely. But that's kind of what's behind what <LINEBREAK> we've assumed here. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>VIVEK JUNEJA: <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> And just as a clarification, with the inflows you've seen recently in deposits with the crisis, <LINEBREAK> this is in the US, obviously, are the betas tempering a little bit, how much those are going up? Is that slowing <LINEBREAK> down, or not any change so far? <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> So a couple things I mentioned. So one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with <LINEBREAK> some of the sector turmoil. We've looked at kind of deposit levels from call it March 7 th , March 8 th <MULTISPACE> through <LINEBREAK> close to the end of March, and we certainly did see an uptick, call it probably a little bit under $30 billion or <LINEBREAK> so of inflows in that period of time, with a good portion of that in our CCB, our Commercial Middle-Market <LINEBREAK> client base. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely <LINEBREAK> be sticky. I think what's important here is that part of our strategy here is in fact growing operating deposits <LINEBREAK> with our large multinational clients and our middle-market clients, and so we're going to continue to be <LINEBREAK> focused on that. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What's a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas <LINEBREAK> actually evolve, and we'll have to kind of wait and see. It's too soon to tell as it relates to that. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.

Hey, Mark, just a follow-up on the credit. So you mentioned obviously that you moved <LINEBREAK> your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit in your weightings, and you had previously talked about <LINEBREAK> getting towards normalized card losses, I think you'd said by around the end of the year. So can you just <LINEBREAK> given the changes that we're seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, <LINEBREAK> can you just, are you still on line for that getting to that 3-3.5% and 5-5.5% in the respective card <LINEBREAK> businesses by around year-end this year? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, year-end, early next year, yes. We're still kind of on track, on trend for that. Again, I'd <LINEBREAK> expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But the answer to your <LINEBREAK> question, Ken, is yes. That's still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024 reaching those normalized levels. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>KEN USDIN: </BOLD> Okay, cool. And then one more just follow-up. End-of-period deposits down 3%, you <LINEBREAK> mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes, is the tax impact felt across the business? When I look at the deposits <LINEBREAK> page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis, and just trying to get a sense <LINEBREAK> of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the <LINEBREAK> other pieces that you've already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows, and everything else in <LINEBREAK> between. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, it's a good question. So, again, when you look at our deposits on an average basis, <LINEBREAK> you see on page 26 that they tick up a little bit. If you look at it on an end of period basis, they're down about <LINEBREAK> 3%, and essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase <LINEBREAK> in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits, and then <LINEBREAK> we have the seasonality point that I referenced in my prepared remarks where we have both operational <LINEBREAK> payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments with our TTS clients, also with Wealth clients <LINEBREAK> to some extent kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits. And again, that for the most part is <LINEBREAK> normal operating payments that we'd expect to see at this time of year. <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> So no surprises in what happened. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> Thank you. Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is <LINEBREAK> open. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MIKE MAYO</BOLD> : Hi. Just one clarification on that last answer. You said you had intra-quarter flows. Did you <LINEBREAK> gain more deposits in the month of March, and was that in the US? <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yes, that's what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in <LINEBREAK> the US in the month of March, call it March 8 th <MULTISPACE> through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed <LINEBREAK> by these normal payments that I referenced, and we did, we still see good activity kind of even as we came <LINEBREAK> through March and into early parts of April. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> And that was both in the Institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in PBWM. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yes, in Wealth. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MIKE MAYO</BOLD> : And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I'm oversimplifying, correct me, but, look, you <LINEBREAK> have 5,000 multinationals you really target for payments, Capital Markets and Banking. Those companies <LINEBREAK> have a lot of deposits, a lot of Services. That's the stickiness and that's where you said 80% of your clients <LINEBREAK> in TTS have been with you for over 15 years. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What if the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals, and I know I'm asking you to slice and dice in a little <LINEBREAK> bit different way, but even just a general sense, because the reason I'm asking this is because I think there's <LINEBREAK>

<BOLD>T RANSCRIP T</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Citi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Review</BOLD> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD>April 14, 2023 </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC><BOLD> </BOLD></ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Copyright © 2023 Citigroup Inc. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 20 <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a disconnect between showing percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness, and I don't think <LINEBREAK> that's valid, and you've showed higher deposits even though you have a big percentage of uninsured <LINEBREAK> deposits or maybe that doesn't matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting, so if <LINEBREAK> you could address that. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MARK MASON: </BOLD> Yeah, thanks, Mike. Look, I'd tell you to turn to page 26 in the earnings presentation. We've <LINEBREAK> broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have, and at the bottom, you see the TTS <LINEBREAK> deposits, and this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside, and you can see the <LINEBREAK> stability, as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely <LINEBREAK> operational deposits that these clients have with us, and we shouldn't mistake rate sensitivity or betas with <LINEBREAK> stickiness, right, and it's because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now, they're price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to reprice those. But remember, <LINEBREAK> the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships, and that's what <LINEBREAK> gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits both in the US and outside of the <LINEBREAK> US. And so the other page, in your own time you can look at it is the page prior to that which again speaks <LINEBREAK> to the diversification of the portfolio but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have <LINEBREAK> been with us and have grown with us, and so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have a greater <LINEBREAK> than 15 year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And so anyway, those are the two points I'd make. <LINEBREAK> Hopefully that addresses your question around the stickiness. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JANE FRASER: </BOLD> Yeah, I often say it takes a root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just <LINEBREAK> because of exactly what we're talking about here, and that's also we see it even with the mid-market clients <LINEBREAK> that are a growing portion here as well because we're helping them expand internationally, and that <LINEBREAK> stickiness comes through and the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio. <LINEBREAK> <BOLD> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>OPERATOR: </BOLD> Thank you. <BOLD> </BOLD> And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jenn <LINEBREAK> Landis for closing remarks. <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>JENNIFER LANDIS: </BOLD> Thank you everyone for joining us today.
