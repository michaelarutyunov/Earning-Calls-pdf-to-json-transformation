<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... <MULTISPACE> </ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Operator:</BOLD> Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Barnum. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <ITALIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... <MULTISPACE> </ITALIC> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the back. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS of $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows, most <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average deposits <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> were down 3% quarter-on-quarter while end-of-period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter - implying an intra-quarter reversal of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of these deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> inflows at quarter-end. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's important to note that while the sequential period-end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year NII outlook - which I will address at the end - still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and credit card spend up 10% year-on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, driven by the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Markets revenue was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> down $371 million or 4% year-on-year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year-on-year, driven by compensation-related costs reflecting the annualization of last <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results include the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge-offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted-average economic outlook. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which was primarily <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monitor their activity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> closely. Spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year-on-year. In Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year-on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter- <LINEBREAK> on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 1% year-on-year, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> down 38% year-on-year, largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 3 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to Card Services and Auto - revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year-on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year-on-year. Expenses of $8.1 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion were up 5% year-on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charge-offs were $1.1 billion, up <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about $500 million year-on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> down 24% year-on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 34% for debt and 6% for equity. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter, as well as through the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year-on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> was up 55%, with the growth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> up 7% year-on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year-on-year driven by higher rates, and gross <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year-on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal activity. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> technology investments, as well as higher volume-related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on- <LINEBREAK> quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non-operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Loans were up 13% year-on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter-on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, which is also <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> leading to weakness in capex spending. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quarter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments. And given <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the recent focus on commercial real estate, let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in urban dense markets; and nearly two-thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> $417 million included a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre-tax margin <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 billion was up 11% year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the impact of lower <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year-on-year, predominantly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related compensation and the run-rate impact <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of acquisitions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> For the quarter, net long-term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year-on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long-term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> securities-based lending, while average deposits were down 5%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net loss of $881 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year-on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> were down $24 million year-on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 4 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in guidance is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance increases are not a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run-rate in the medium-term <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance; and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> while we don't know exactly when this lower run-rate will be reached, when it happens, we believe it will be around the mid-70s. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of <BOLD>Q</BOLD>T and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> macroeconomic environment - including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pending FDIC special assessment. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge-off rate to be approximately 2.6%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have benefited from our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that - operator please open the line for <BOLD>Q</BOLD>&<BOLD>A</BOLD>. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD><BOLD>Q</BOLD>UESTION <BOLD>A</BOLD>ND <BOLD>A</BOLD>NSWER SECTION </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Operator</BOLD>: Please stand by. The first question is coming from the line of Steve Chubak with Wolfe Research, now open. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Steven Chubak <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Wolfe Research LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hey, good morning. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Good morning, Steve. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Steven Chubak <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Wolfe Research LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> planning for - whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd along those same lines, how you're thinking about the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Look, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happens like this, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held-to-maturity, maybe more TL<BOLD>A</BOLD>C for certain <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole system, just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recalibrating things the right way. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and regional <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> banks. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd certain actions are taken which are drastic - it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expect higher capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment - that'll be what it is. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

Obviously, capital is more than that, but - and we did a little bit of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Steven Chubak <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Wolfe Research LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's great.

The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may proceed. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ken Usdin <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Jefferies LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in the rate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does take some pressure off the reprice. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd as you said, we're getting a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short-term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our folks in the branches. It's been very attractive to yield-seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then on the asset side, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contributed to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way. But as Jamie's pointed out - those uncertainties are all still there, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium-term we remain very focused on those. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> ...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... </IT<BOLD>A</BOLD>LIC> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 6 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ken Usdin <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Jefferies LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, and as a follow-up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner - how do you take a look at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do you think it's because <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kind of your general <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> thinking about the other read-throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short-term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is - it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short-term read is higher recessionary risk and then <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> inflation coming down. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> curve will have to go up a little bit. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ken Usdin <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Jefferies LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay.

Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> March - in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook - we don't see it as a major driver. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> John McDonald <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, <BOLD>A</BOLD>utonomous Research <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then I wanted to ask Jamie - there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch - banks are going to stop <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that makes sense - that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> certain real estate things. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale. It just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter, it increases the odds of a recession - that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Operator:</BOLD> Thank you.

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 7 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Erika Najarian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, UBS Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions. I'm <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take - not going to go into a lot of detail here - but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bunch of different scenarios and we probability-weight those. The central case outlook from our research team hasn't actually changed, but we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it made sense to add a little bit of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that, which changed the weighted-average expectation. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I think that the weighted-average <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Erika Najarian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, UBS Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, as you think about all of what you've just told us - so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 5.8% unemployment. <BOLD>A</BOLD>s we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2024 - assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting - given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the reserve? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. <BOLD>A</BOLD> very serious <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Erika Najarian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, UBS Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Operator:</BOLD> The next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities.

Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you think that you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lose them going forward? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing - do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pricing power for the larger banks? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. <BOLD>A</BOLD> couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent and appropriate for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> us to assume that they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirely possible that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being realistic about the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stickiness of it. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing - and we look at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pricing sheets all the time - every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three-month, six-month, nine-month <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> savings rates. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing power for the bank, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jim Mitchell <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> No, fair - all fair points. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd maybe just a follow-up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> back. <BOLD>A</BOLD>re you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that correction <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happens naturally - credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale, and that might make them leave our pre- <LINEBREAK> existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jim Mitchell <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Seaport Global Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay.

Hi, Jeremy. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hey, Gerard. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Gerard Cassidy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up next year, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we have the stress test coming this summer or in June - the results - which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50-basis-point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assumption. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> own process is actually quite limited. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by almost a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our ability to predict the SCB. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we'll know soon enough what that actual number is. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Gerard Cassidy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then just as a follow-up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color - I think you mentioned in building the loan loss <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reserve this quarter you identified some one-off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it - there's some larger credits. Were they <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? <BOLD>A</BOLD>ny more color there? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> No, it wasn't commercial real estate.

Poonawala <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Bank of <BOLD>A</BOLD>merica Merrill Lynch <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, obviously, you're <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply - and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that probably goes beyond office into apartments - how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> going into a weakening economy? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re-fi wall that's coming up? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> commercial real estate exposure is multi-family lending in supply constrained markets. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I think it's quite important to recognize the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non-rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, of course, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi-family <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Can I just add also, housing is in short supply in <BOLD>A</BOLD>merica. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then in terms of the office space, as you know, our exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re-fi dynamics <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite modest, very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> concentrated in Class <BOLD>A</BOLD> buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers - is generally in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> things for us, not a big issue. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ebrahim H. Poonawala <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Bank of <BOLD>A</BOLD>merica Merrill Lynch <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this - the ability of the economy, the financial markets to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if duration mismatch and bank balance <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> should - for our planning - I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then think about the five- and ten-year rate which could be 5%, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I think if those things happen - I'm not saying they're going to happen - I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of the banks here. People <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> exposed to re-fi risk. Those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients - now would be the time to fix it. Do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera. That's answer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> number one. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very - we think - it's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> very, very secure.

You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd on the topic of loan pricing, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Mike Mayo <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>ll right. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or <BOLD>A</BOLD>LM - you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> could call this nightmare on <BOLD>A</BOLD>LM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 12 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test - the CC<BOLD>A</BOLD>R stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> going up and being prepared - whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store - you get to deploy it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd this whole banking thing was bad for banks. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I knew that the second I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> get through this. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd we all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> did that - all of us - did that during COVID. <BOLD>A</BOLD>ll of us did that - if you could, those who could - did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would expect people to do that going forward. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Mike Mayo <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks later? <BOLD>A</BOLD>re you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> talking contagion or what? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. So it's just - the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much <BOLD>A</BOLD>TM, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> too much uninsured deposits. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you're going to see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. <BOLD>A</BOLD> lot of people are going to have - can take - actions to remediate some of the issues <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> they may have going forward. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Buffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million - I don't know if you saw that - that no depositor will lose money in <BOLD>A</BOLD>merica. That he's willing to bet his own money. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd of course, you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. It will pass. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> before about interest rates - people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd if it doesn't happen, serendipity. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Mike Mayo <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Wells Fargo Securities LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>ll right.

LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non-Markets NII... <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> No, hear me? Hello? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Go ahead. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. You're back now. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> forward curve, if I understand correctly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> because I'm trying to triangulate here about - maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that - that's the question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Go ahead, Jeremy. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then I'll go. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd at this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call - the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 14 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> little bit less. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine - this is a little inside baseball now - the number that we're <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and saying this is kind of a range. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it - like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then the follow-up is just on the buybacks. So do I take <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> your comments to mean that you're on pause now? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> it's cheap, not just when it's available. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cautious. So we're going to make this decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RW<BOLD>A</BOLD>s? How much should we be baking in for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> those? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we were maybe a little bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> it's likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it's not too much worse than that. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> so when the NPR comes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces - the holistic review. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd it's going to take a lot of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> time to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Got it. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd there were supposed - I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> global economy, which are getting smaller. The G-SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for that. So, it may very - we're expecting it go up, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd JPMorgan - there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> well, it's a capital issue. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd even the banks, by the way, when you look at it - even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear - I can look <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for loans. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 15 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This is based on the current rule set. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> them. I'm talking about just loans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to - I mean a lot of credit go to non-banks, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system. That's fine. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If that's what they want, that's fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Betsy L. Graseck <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co.

But thanks, appreciate it. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Operator:</BOLD> Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Glenn Schorr <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Evercore ISI <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee-jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is - consumers can move excess cash <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra accounts, whatever. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> their cash balances and working capital - and should they need to? <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big changes to speak of. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I do think it's just worth saying - I think you're sort of hinting at this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates - that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> uninsured deposits, that's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non-operating uninsured deposits from financial <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like core banking business <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for all of us. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move - or I would call excess cash <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash - <MULTISPACE> so think even of a small companies, middle market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> companies, et cetera - that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more competitive in rates. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd that's why I think you see lot of regional banks - they've got sticky middle market deposits. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd they also are more competitive on the rate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class - there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I think they have already - as the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Fed has raised rates, you've already seen - that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

Just follow-up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strategies including partnerships and securitizations.

That's the difference. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships. You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd we'll shed certain assets, too. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Glenn Schorr <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD>nalyst, Evercore ISI <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Q</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah.

You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> balances. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd I guess, is it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. <BOLD>A</BOLD>nd so also, to Mike's question earlier, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we're seeing a higher yield there as well. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that yet, so. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's normalization. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Barnum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's a good thing for us. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

Is that kind of what drove it again this quarter, or is there some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> kind of broader, overarching… <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jamie Dimon <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>A</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That'll be every quarter for the rest of our lives.
