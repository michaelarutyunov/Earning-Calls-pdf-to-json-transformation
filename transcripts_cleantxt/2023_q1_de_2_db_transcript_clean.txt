<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> CHRISTIAN SEWING <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 1 - Strong performance in volatile markets <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Silke, and welcome from me, too! <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's a pleasure to discuss our first quarter 2023 results with you today <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and we are pleased with the progress we continue to make towards our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2025 goals <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The first quarter was marked by turbulent conditions in the banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sector, particularly in March, in addition to the macro-economic <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> challenges. However, our transformation has provided us with strong <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> foundations which enabled us to navigate these challenges successfully <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We delivered on four critical dimensions <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> First, profitability: pre-tax profits increased by 12% to 1.9 billion euros, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and post-tax profit by 8% to 1.3 billion euros, which on both counts <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> represents our strongest first quarter since 2013 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our cost/income ratio was 71% this quarter, 2 percentage points better <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> than the prior year, driven by positive operating leverage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We also generated an 8.3% post-tax return on tangible equity this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> period <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As you know, annual bank levies are recognized in the first quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Spreading these bank levies equally across the four quarters of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year, our first quarter cost/income ratio would be 67% with a post-tax <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> return on tangible equity of 10% - putting us well on track to our 2025 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> targets <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Second, we proved the strength of our franchise. Our business model is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> focused on four client-centric businesses which complement each other <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and provide a well-diversified earnings mix, as this quarter shows. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> delivered revenues of 7.7 billion euros, up 5% over the prior year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Third, we again proved our resilience <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 13.6%, up from 13.4% in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> previous quarter and 12.8% in the first quarter of last year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our liquidity reserves were 241 billion euros and our liquidity coverage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio rose to 143% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Finally, sustainability is an important part of our strategy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As you heard at our Sustainability Deep Dive in March, we have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> updated our business strategies and policies and expanded on our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 3 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> commitments in several ways to fight climate change. Namely our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> thermal coal policy and our ambition is to encourage our corporate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clients to commit to net zero <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This quarter, we made further progress toward our target of 500 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros of sustainable financing and investments, excluding DWS, by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> end-2025; our cumulative volume since January 2020 has grown to 238 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euros <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let me now turn to slide 2 to discuss the strong performance across our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> divisions this quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 2 - Continued progress across all divisions <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We saw good momentum across all businesses and delivered on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strategic steps which support our 2025 targets and strengthen our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Global Hausbank model <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The Corporate Bank showed financial strength with record revenues <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and good client activity across our main businesses. I am pleased that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we are winning mandates with top clients to support working capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and their global value chain <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In the Investment Bank, we added talent to support growth and we are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expanding our core franchise. We increased our global market share by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more than 40 basis points compared to the previous quarter in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Origination and Advisory and achieved year-on-year revenue growth in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Rates for the 5th consecutive quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This reflects our ongoing investments, especially in capital light <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business areas <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The Private Bank produced its best-ever operating revenues, grew <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets under management and captured net inflows. We also <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> successfully completed the next wave of the Postbank IT migration at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the beginning of April, transferring over 6.5 million contracts from 5 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million Postbank clients - this will unlock the 300 million euros of cost <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> efficiencies, as we previously communicated <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Asset Management saw inflows of 6 billion euros, and 9 billion euros <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> excluding Cash, despite turbulent markets. Stefan Hoops is progressing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with the strategy by investing into transformation to create a stand- <LINEBREAK> alone platform while expanding the product offering. Xtrackers <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> launched the largest ETF of all time in the US of approximately 2 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> US dollars. This is also the single largest climate investing ETF launch <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Turning now to the pre-provision profit on slide 3 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

The Investment Bank also produced a solid <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> underlying contribution against an exceptionally strong prior year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The rebalancing towards our stable revenue businesses is especially <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> visible when looking at their contribution to the total Group's pre- <LINEBREAK> provision profit on a last-twelve-month basis. The Corporate Bank and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Private Bank alone have contributed 70% over this period <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> You will recall that our Corporate & Other results were negatively <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> impacted by Valuation & Timing in the prior year quarter. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> anticipated that these would reverse over time and we are benefiting <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from this effect this quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The momentum and balance we see across our four businesses gives us <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> confidence we have the right business model and a strong platform to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> further improve returns <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 4 - Reinforcing cost agenda across front office and infrastructure <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In addition to our growth focus, we maintained our discipline on costs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> as we continue to invest in technology and controls and face <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> inflationary pressures <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In February, we said that we were working on additional efficiency <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> measures which we are now implementing, and which are shown on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> slide 4 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 5 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The changes we announced to the management board yesterday <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> should support this agenda. The creation of a group chief operating <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> officer will help us to deliver our strategic transformation agenda and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> drive inefficiencies out of the bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are also focused on right-sizing our non-client facing functions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> During the second quarter we will begin to reduce our senior non-client <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> facing workforce by 5% and will limit new hiring without compromising <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our controls <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We continue to align our German Private Bank to the current trends and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> market environment including actions to streamline our mortgage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> platform <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In addition, we are working on a series of productivity measures <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> including sophisticated capacity planning in several areas, including <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> anti-financial crime <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our target is to increase returns over time, and we continue to look for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more opportunities to deliver on this, I will speak about this later <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 5 - Well diversified loan book and deposit base, supported by strong <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital and liquidity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let me now turn to our balance sheet strength and resilient funding <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profile on slide 5 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Once again, we benefitted from disciplined risk management and our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strong and stable balance sheet <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our loan book is well-diversified across businesses and regions. Around <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 70% of the book is secured or hedged, and almost 80% of our loan <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> portfolio is in stable and mostly lower-risk businesses in the Private <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank and Corporate Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Nearly half of our book is based in Germany, and 40% is equally <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> distributed across EMEA and North America with the remainder in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> APAC <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our deposit base funds about 60% of the net balance sheet and our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> loan-to-deposit ratio was 82% at quarter end <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Over 80% of our deposits are from most stable client segments such as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> retail, corporates, small and medium-sized enterprises or sovereigns <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> where we have long-standing and deep-rooted client relationships <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 77% of our German retail deposits are insured via the statutory <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> protection scheme. In the Corporate Bank, close to three quarters of all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

James will say more on deposits later <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our CET1 ratio strengthened to 13.6%, 250 basis points above the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> MDA requirement, and our highest level for two years. Our leverage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio was 4.6% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As I said, our liquidity metrics remained sound, the LCR was 143%, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> above our target of around 130%, with a buffer of 63 billion euros above <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> regulatory required levels <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The net stable funding ratio was 120%, at the high end of the Group's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> target range of 115-120%, and 100 billion euros above required levels <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To summarise, we have solid foundations to navigate through the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recent turbulent environment. And importantly, I view the European <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> banking sector as stable, thanks in part to the regulatory efforts of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recent years <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to slide 6 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 6 - Global Hausbank strategy positioned to support our clients through <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> every cycle <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The current environment underlines the importance of our Global <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hausbank model, which positions us well to serve clients in volatile <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> markets <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> When we set out our strategy in March last year, we outlined the key <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> themes which underpin these goals and ambitions, and these themes <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have become even more important in light of the geopolitical and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> macro-economic upheavals since then <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> path toward our 2025 goals, benefiting from a strategy and business <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> model which are well aligned to market trends <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We will leverage the more favorable interest rate environment, deploy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our risk management expertise to support clients, and allocate capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to high-return growth opportunities <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With sustainability being so important, we will deepen our dialogue <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with, and support for clients, expand our product range, and broaden <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our agenda for our own operations <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We will also continue to benefit from the investments we are making in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> technology together with our strategic partners. The investments <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 7 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> should accelerate our transition to a digital bank and the benefits <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> should be seen in our efficiency and controls <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> These technology investments are also designed to create value for our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clients <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We believe we have the right strategy and the right focus on clients <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which should allow us to accelerate execution of our strategy, enhance <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our franchise and drive returns. We see these opportunities on three <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dimensions which we detail on slide 7 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 7 - Accelerated execution of strategic agenda driving returns <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have committed to self-fund our investments and increase <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> operating leverage through efficiencies, and we now see additional <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> scope to do that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We already indicated that we aim to deliver incremental operational <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> efficiencies greater than the two billion euros identified at the 2022 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> investor deep dive. As discussed, we are in the process of identifying <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and executing on a further 500 million euros of benefits which we will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> work to extract <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The incremental benefits will come from a strategic review of our entire <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> workforce, further optimizing the distribution networks in the Private <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank. We also expect to see benefits in operations and process <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> automation, and we are excited about the opportunities that should <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> emerge from artificial intelligence and machine learning <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Second, we are focusing on capital efficiency. Deploying capital to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> increase shareholder value has always been our priority and we see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> opportunities to re-allocate capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We aim to free up 15 to 20 billion euros of risk weighted assets from <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reductions in certain sub-hurdle lending and mortgage portfolios, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> greater utilization of securitization and hedging optimization <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> These actions are expected to have a minimal impact on revenues but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will enable us to increase returns and re-allocate resources to more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital-accretive businesses <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We believe that the combination of cost and capital efficiency together <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with additional opportunities across markets should position us to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outperform our existing growth objectives <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To support this, we continue to invest into our platforms, and to take <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> opportunities created by current market conditions to attract talent to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 8 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strengthen advisory capabilities in various businesses and regions, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> including Asia <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We expect these actions to accelerate the execution of our strategy and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more importantly, increase returns to shareholders over time <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Before I hand over to James, let me summarize our progress on slide 8 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 8 - Summary <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our performance in the first quarter demonstrates the strength of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Deutsche Bank's franchise, earnings power and balance sheet <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our transformation has given us a strong platform for growth, with a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> diversified business model providing well-balanced earnings <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This provides a strong step-off to accelerate our Global Hausbank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ambition through additional actions on the three dimensions we just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> discussed <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We remain fully committed to our capital distribution plan. With a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> successful first quarter behind us and strong capital we have now <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> initiated the dialog with the supervisors about share buybacks which <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are expected to take place in the second half of this year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This is line with the promise we made last quarter that we initiate this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> step once we have greater clarity on a number of issues, including the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> macro environment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Everything we have seen this quarter supports our view that we are on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the right path. The Group is well positioned to capitalize on current <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> trends to drive returns above the cost of equity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that, let me hand over to James <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> JAMES VON MOLTKE <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 10 - Key performance indicators <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Christian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let me start with a few key performance indicators in the first quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on slide 10, and put them in the context of our 2025 targets <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have strong revenue momentum. A well-balanced business mix <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> enables us to benefit from higher interest rates despite challenging <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> financial markets, delivering revenue growth above our 2025 targeted <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> compounded annual growth rate on a last twelve-month basis <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 9 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our post-tax return on tangible equity was 8.3% in the first quarter, or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 10% pro-rating bank levies through the year, already in line with our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2025 target <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have made steady progress on our cost/income ratio which was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 71% in the quarter, a 4-percentage point improvement on full year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2022. If the bank levies were pro-rated across the year, the cost/income <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio would be 67%. The first quarter performance shows clear progress <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> toward our 2025 target of less than 62.5% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And we demonstrated the strength of our capital and balance sheet, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and the quality of our loan book, in challenging conditions. Our capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio was 13.6% in the first quarter, in line with our 2025 target of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> around 13% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that let me turn to the first-quarter highlights on slide 11 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 11 - Q1 2023 highlights <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Group revenues were 7.7 billion euros, up 5% on the first quarter of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2022 and with a better balance across our businesses <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Noninterest expenses were 5.5 billion euros and adjusted costs of 5.4 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euros were essentially flat year on year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We booked bank levies of 473 million euros this quarter, down 35% year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on year as a result of a reduction in the sector-wide single resolution <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fund assessment as well as our improved relative sector contribution <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and an increased use of irrevocable commitments <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our provision for credit losses was 372 million euros or 30 basis points <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of average loans. Overall, credit losses remained well contained despite <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a small number of idiosyncratic events <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We generated a profit before tax of 1.9 billion euros, up 12%, and net <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profit of 1.3 billion euros, up 8%, compared to the prior year quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our cost/income ratio came in at 71%, down 2 percentage points versus <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the prior year period <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Diluted earnings per share was 61 cents in the first quarter with an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> effective tax rate of 29% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Tangible book value per share was 27 euros and 28 cents, up 2% on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fourth quarter of 2022 and up 8% year on year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now let me turn to some of the drivers of these results, starting with our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> NIM development on slide 12 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

This <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter, the accounting effect resulted in a sequential impact on Group <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> NIM of around negative 20 basis points <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This effect is held in C&O where it is fully offset by an increase in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> noninterest revenue and there is no economic loss to the firm or overall <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> impact on group P&L <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Realized deposit betas remain favorable when compared to our models <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> but we expect this to partially normalize in the coming quarters as the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pace of interest rate rises slows <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Average interest earning assets declined modestly driven mainly by our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> TLTRO prepayments <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that: let's turn to costs, on slide 13 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 13 - Adjusted costs - Q1 2023 (YoY) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Adjusted costs excluding bank levies of 4.9 billion euros were flat <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sequentially but increased by 5% year on year or 240 million euros <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This reflected cumulative investments over the past twelve months in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> technology, controls and people, together with higher business activity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and inflationary pressures <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The monthly average run-rate of around 1.63 billion euros is in line with <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our prior guidance, and we expect to operate at the run-rate of between <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 1.6 and 1.65 billion euros per month for the rest of the year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Looking at the individual components: <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Compensation and benefits costs were essentially flat, as increased <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fixed remuneration was offset by lower variable remuneration. Ongoing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> workforce optimization limited the impact of higher headcount <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> IT costs were up 66 million euros, 8% year on year, reflecting continued <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> investments in technology and innovation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Professional services increased by 25 million euros driven by Business <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Consulting and Legal fees <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

The majority of this increase was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driven by the Private Bank and included a small number of idiosyncratic <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> events in the International Private Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This was partly offset by a release of 26 million euros in Stages 1 and 2 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> provisions, partially driven by a slight improvement in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> macroeconomic outlook since the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a charge of 178 million euros in the prior year quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We did not see a wider deterioration in the portfolio outside of this small <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> number of specific events, and overall credit quality remains high <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> For the full year 2023, we reaffirm our previous guidance range of 25 to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 30 basis points of average loans <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 15 - Commercial Real Estate (CRE) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let me also cover our Commercial Real Estate portfolio on slide 15 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our 33-billion-euro CRE focus portfolio represents 7% of our loan book, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and as you know it consists of non-recourse lending within the core <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> CRE business units in the Investment Bank and the Corporate Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As a reminder, we have provided disclosure on this focus portfolio since <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the Covid crisis <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The portfolio is well diversified across regions and property types <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Despite the headwinds facing the sector, we are comfortable with our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> exposure for several reasons: <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> First, our loan originations are focused on larger, institutional quality <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets in more liquid primary markets and with strong institutional <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sponsorship <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

The decline in part <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reflected a normalization from the elevated levels seen in the second <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> half of last year and was broadly in-line with the market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> About a third of the reduction in balances came at the end of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter as certain clients repositioned parts of their exposures. This <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> constitutes about 1% of our overall deposit portfolio and speaks to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> underlying quality of our book <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Deposits in the Corporate Bank declined by 7% sequentially or 6% if <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> adjusted for FX, mostly due to normalizations from elevated levels in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> last two quarters as well as increased pricing competition <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Private Bank deposits declined by 2% in the quarter. Approximately <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 30% of flows migrated into higher yielding investment products in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Private Bank while the remainder reflected the ongoing inflationary <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pressures and increasing price competition <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Before we move to performance in our businesses, let me turn to capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on slide 17 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 17 - Capital metrics <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio came in at 13.6%, up by 25 basis points <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> compared to the previous quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Net capital build was 30 basis points, reflecting our strong organic <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital generation from net income, partially offset by higher equity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> compensation awards <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Risk weighted assets grew modestly, reducing the CET 1 ratio only by 6 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> basis points <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Credit risk weighted assets increased, primarily due to seasonal loan <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> growth in the Investment Bank and Corporate Bank.

Revenues in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Wealth Management & Bank for Entrepreneurs were up 4% or 7% if <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> adjusted for the impact of the sale of our Financial Advisors business in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Italy. Revenues in Premium Banking declined by 1% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Noninterest expenses were up 10%, partly due to the non-recurrence of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> releases of restructuring provisions which benefitted the prior year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter. Adjusted costs increased by 5% year on year due to higher <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> internal service cost allocations, higher investment spending including <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> costs related to the Postbank IT migration, and inflation impacts partly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offset by lower bank levies and savings from transformation initiatives <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Net inflows were 6 billion euros in the quarter, driven by growth in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> investment products in both Germany and the International Private <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Provision for credit losses was 267 million euros, up from 101 million <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros in the prior year quarter.

As <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> confirmed earlier, we expect the monthly run-rate of adjusted costs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> excluding bank levies to be about 1.6 to 1.65 billion euros for the rest of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To deliver on the cost reduction measures which Christian outlined, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> now expect to record restructuring and severance provisions of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> approximately 500 million euros in 2023 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In line with our previous guidance, provision for credit losses is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expected in the range of 25 to 30 basis points of average loans <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian mentioned our commitment to capital distributions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Consistent with our path laid out at the investor deep dive last year, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have proposed a cash dividend of 30 euro cents per share for approval <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

My first question relates to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Goldman Sachs) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital return. Clearly, profitability and capital formation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> was better than expected in the first quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Previously, you've commented that the timing and size <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of potential share buybacks this year would be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dependent on getting clarity on the size of regulatory <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> model headwinds and the macro-outlook. And today, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you've said that you've initiated dialogue with the ECB. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What updates do you have on those headwinds? How <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> comfortable do you feel on the macro backdrop? And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> how far are you with those ECB discussions, and what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> does that all mean for the potential timing and size of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> share buybacks this year? That's the first question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then, secondly, perhaps for Christian, coming back to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> slide 7. If we look across those three pillars, costs, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital and revenues, could you talk a little bit about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> what these measures really mean incrementally to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2025 strategy and targets? What are the key timing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> points regarding progress in those areas and are you in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a position to upgrade any of those targets at this point? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hey, Chris, it's Christian. Good morning and thank you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> very much for your question. I'm sure James will jump <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in, I'm going after both questions and, again, James will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> contribute. On your first question, I think it was very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> important for us, for the Management Board and for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James and myself, that we wanted to see the first <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter development. And, indeed, this development is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> not only important, but gives us all the confidence and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> all the tailwind we need when it comes to the further <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 20 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> trajectory of our results. If you really look at the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> composition of our results, that what makes me so <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> positive and confident, is the stable business <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> development in the Private Bank and in the Corporate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If you then think about that, what James already <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outlined in the previous calls and what we always refer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to, that the real tailwind in the interest rates is coming <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the Private Bank only in the outer years, in 2024, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2025. With the momentum that we see right now <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> already in the stable business, that was obviously the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> right starting point now to change gears and to initiate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the discussions on the share buybacks with the ECB. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Secondly, to take a step back. I think also in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> aftermath, it was right not to do this end of January <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> because we said on purpose, we would like to have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> better view on the economic development, on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> volatility in the market, the turbulence we see. Look, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> did not know what happened in March, but you could <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> see that also the way we handled that situation, again, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the stability now with the step-off of 13.6% of CET1, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> not even talking about the strong liquidity number of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 143% of LCR, all gives us now the confidence to say <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this is the right moment to start. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thirdly, I do believe that the environment, the economic <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outlook for Europe, particularly for Germany, you may <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have seen the guidance of the German Economic <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Minister yesterday, and we agree to that. We don't see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a recession in Germany coming in 2023. It's slow <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> growth, minimal growth, but actually, far better than <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that what we thought could happen at the end of 2022 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for the year 2023. Also there, clearly better visibility <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> when it comes to the economic outlook. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And James will give you more details when it comes to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the model changes, but also there we did a lot of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> progress and have far better visibility what it means. In <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this regard, we concluded, based on this, in our view, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> really good quarter numbers, that it's now time to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> approach the discussions, initiate the discussions with <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> regard to timing. In line with that, what I said on 2 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> February, we believe that the share buybacks will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happen in the second half of 2023. There I used the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> word optimistic, now I use the words that I'm very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> confident that this will happen in the second half of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2023. With regard to the amount, I think we need to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have the discussions with the ECB, but James and I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> both believe in consistency. If you think about the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> increase in the dividends which we propose for the year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2022 versus the previous year, I think for consistent <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reasons we should also think about such an increase <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> when it comes to share buyback. James, potentially you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> step in on the model before I take the second question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure, happy to do that. Chris, remember in the February <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2nd call, we were talking about the model impact. There <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are a number of different items. One big one, which is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> what we call the wholesale model review, but then <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> many other items, some of which are netting. And so, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there is a range of outcomes, but at this point, with <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> better visibility into the discussions, we'd probably say <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that range is between 40 and 60 basis points of capital. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If you take the mid-point of that, which is a pretty good <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> place to be for modelling purposes, that 50 basis points <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> actually represents about the organic capital generation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that consensus would suggest we earn in the balance of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the year. Now, obviously, we'd like to do better than <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that, but if you use that, essentially earnings for the rest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of the year would offset the model impact. That leaves <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> us a gap to 13.2% CET1 to fund growth, a buyback and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> any other events during the year, uncertainty is in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> first two numbers, which we feel pretty good about. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And to give you a sense that, therefore, the range of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outcomes that Christian refers to, we think at this point <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is affordable, based on the information we have. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To your second question and slide 7. First of all, I really <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would like to say it's nothing else, Chris, that continuous <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> development of our strategy and the confirmation of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the strategy and the trajectory which we have taken <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> over the last years. But of course, when you are in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> middle of that, you see the client reaction, you see the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 22 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> momentum I was just talking about before. In the stable <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business, the foundation and the resilience which we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have found in the Investment Bank, then obviously you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> always reconsider what else can we do. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let me start on the business side, on the right-hand <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> side of the slide. Number one, yes, momentum in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business is so important because it goes back to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> something which I always try to outline in this call and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which I think sometimes gets still underestimated, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that is all about our people. If they see these results, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> when you think about the momentum, the passion, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> spirit in this bank, you can see that in particular now, in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Corporate Bank and Private Bank, it goes only into one <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> direction, and that's what we want to build on. We see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> growth rates, which are higher than what we initially <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> planned. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then there are market opportunities, also as a result of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the events which we have seen in our competitive <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment, also here in Europe, which obviously we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would like to bank on. You've seen the one or the other <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> announcement over the last weeks, that we will start to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> do some selective hiring. Very important, either in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Corporate Bank platform or in capital-light businesses, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> like the advisory piece. You also see that we are actually <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> focusing on additional markets. We have hired a team <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for Latin America in the O&A and Financing business, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which is important for us because a lot of German <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clients, corporate clients, are actually there, who want <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to have our help. So, market opportunities are there. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> All that give us the opportunity, again with the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> momentum we see also when I look forward. Obviously <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with the tailwind of the interest rates, that we think the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> revenue growth numbers which we put forward are not <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> only achievable, but we have a real chance to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outperform that. Now, secondly, on the cost <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management side. If you work on those 2 billion euros <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which we laid out and where we gave details in last <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year's IDD, and we always reconfirmed the numbers. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> You then go deeper, you see there is more room and, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> therefore, we also changed the governance in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 23 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management board. We have a clear allocation of cost <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management now in the management board, front to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> back, which will create further opportunities. We also <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> don't only think about more long-term cost changes, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> but the reduction in workforce exercise, which we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> kicked off in March, which will be fully implemented in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Q2, is something which shows you that we see now, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with all that has happened, with the sharpening of our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> businesses, but also implementation of front-to-end <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> processes, that we have more potential than we saw <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> before. Hence, we believe that the additional 500 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million euros is a target and a goal which we should <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> achieve. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thirdly, capital efficiency. To be honest, to criticise <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ourselves, I think we have done a very good capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management, but when it comes to capital efficiency, in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> each and every sub-businesses, we can further step up. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What I like about this exercise, which will in our view <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bring approximately 15 to 20 billion of risk-weighted <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets over the next couple of years in risk-weighted <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets reductions, while not losing revenues over that, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is actually a more disciplined capital allocation. That is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on two or three items. Number one, yes, we will act on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> items which we see, for instance in the German <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> mortgage business. If the counter-cyclical capital buffer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> has been increased, like it was, we obviously will act <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and will move capital out of this business. And either <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> shift it to higher-rewarding businesses or we give it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> back to the shareholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Secondly, we have found ways to increase hedging and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> securitisations. Thirdly, discipline is not only on the cost <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> side, it's in particular on the review of each and every <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> individual reward when it comes to lending, and there <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we need to step up. I think that there are areas in our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> banks, also in the Corporate Bank, where we can do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> better when it comes to risk reward. That will be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> implemented. James will be all over it. And those three <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> items, on top of that what we have seen in Q1, and I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> really would like to focus on that again. It's an 8.3% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> return on equity, but if you quarter-lise, so to say, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 24 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> SRF we are at 10%. We know exactly what happens <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with the SRF payments, it will go down. And we still <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have something in plan for 2024 and 2025, but it will go <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> down. The 10% ROTE in the first quarter is a really <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> good guidance because the first quarter is not an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outlier quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If you now think about these three items, obviously it is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our target to outperform that in 2025. This is the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> confidence we have and with all that, what we really see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in numbers in the first quarter with the old trajectory, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'm really excited about that way and, hence, very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> positive that we can achieve that outperformance. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James, I don't know whether you want to… <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> No, nothing to add. Completely agree. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Chris Hallam <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, that's very comprehensive. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Tom Hallett <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Morning, a few questions from me, please. Firstly, on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (KBW) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits. You saw 27 billion euros of outflows, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> could you just give us a sense of how that evolves <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> throughout the quarter, particularly in and around that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> March period? And looking further out, what are you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seeing quarter to date and how do you see those <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposit trends developing throughout the year? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Secondly, you're sticking to your revenue guidance. I'm <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> just wondering, what gives you the confidence that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> target still holds, given the missing trading, given what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we're seeing quarter to date there? Maybe you could <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> just provide us with an update, division, quarter-to-date <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dynamics, that'll be helpful. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And one final quick one. I'm interested in your <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> discussions with regulators around the CDS issues and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the banking crisis. Do you envisage any change coming, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> maybe through things like liquidity coverage ratio, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> definition changes, or some form of additional levies to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ensure a wider scope for deposits? Any sense where <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you see change would be great. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure. Thanks, Tom, it's James. I'll start. Maybe I'll start <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> where you finished and we'll come back to that with the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> liquidity metrics. Because we manage to the liquidity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 25 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> metrics, rather than to absolute levels of deposits or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> funding. I think it's important to emphasise, we were <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> able to travel through a difficult quarter, especially <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> March, while maintaining and, in fact, improving both <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratios, liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio. And so, it's important to understand what that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> means. We ended the quarter in as good or better a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> position to withstand a 30-day or a one-year stress <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment, than we were at year-end, based on that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strong deposit base, as well as the secured and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> unsecured funding position we're in. We think that's a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> significant achievement for Deutsche Bank, but also for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the industry. I'll talk about this when we go to your third <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> question, but I think LCR and these other tools have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> withstood the test in the month of March. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Turning to deposits, you mentioned the reduction in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits over the course of the quarter. The average <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits were down a little less than 2% over the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter. As you've seen, the spot level was down 4%, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> excluding FX. That, as we look at banks that have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reported so far, and some industry data through <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> February, is reasonably in line with what you've seen on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> both sides of the Atlantic so far. Now as we've talked <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about, there's a lot going on in the deposit books. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Normalisation, in our case, from very high levels of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits that we finished the year with. There was a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> run-up in December, which is one of the reasons for the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> variance between the average and the spot. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> You've also seen a pickup in competition for liquidity, as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> central banks drain liquidity from the market and you do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> see some price-sensitive deposits leaving the bank, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we're just disciplined on pricing, so that represents, if <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you like, a strategy outcome. We have seen clients shift <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits to higher yielding investment alternatives <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> including, but not limited, to money market funds. And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> some of that, as we've pointed out, was within our own <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> system. So, it didn't leave the bank, it just went from <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits to other products. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The other thing that happens in our deposit base is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> usual moves and flows. If you're a very large cash <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 26 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management bank for corporates and institutions, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there's a lot of movement throughout the quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Which means that your specific question is a little bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> hard to pinpoint. We've talked about two-thirds coming <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the first nine or ten weeks of the quarter, and then <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> one third in the last two weeks, including the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> idiosyncratic noise around our name. We think that 1 or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 1.5%, which is what we'd estimate over those last seven <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> or eight business days of the quarter, actually <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> underscores the resilience of the deposit base. And the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> relative absence of, what I'll call "hot money", and DB. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Where did you see it? It was in the portfolios that are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> typically the most price sensitive, and sensitive, if you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> like, to sentiment. In a sense, it's not surprising to see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that amount of reduction. As we come back to your LCR <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> question, I think it proves its value as a tool. Why did <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the ratios stay constant? We don't apply liquidity value <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to those funding sources, including deposits, that are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> most likely to flow out in a stress scenario. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If I put that all together, Tom, we feel pretty good about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the experience and the way we were able to manage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> through that environment. And credit to the teams, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> communication, the client outreach and engagement, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the work that was done in preparation, we feel quite <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> good about performance through that period. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Tom, to the other question on the revenue guidance. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes, high confidence in the mid-point of 28 to 29 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros. And why? Because I'm really drawing a lot of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> comfort from the stable business. If there is even room <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for improvement, it comes from the Private Bank and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the Corporate Bank. If I give you my numbers which I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have in my head, even if you say the first quarter in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Corporate Bank was a stellar quarter, we're potentially <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on the deposit better, we may see some reduction. But <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clearly, the Corporate Bank will be well above 7 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros of revenues for the year. We started with the 1.9 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euros and, again, if I see the forecasts and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> momentum we have there, it will be clearly a number <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> well above 7 billion euros. The Private Bank, in my view, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is very stable. And again, think about what we always <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 27 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> said before, that the real impact of the tailwind is still to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> come. If I look at last year, if I look at this year, if I look <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at the first quarter, a number well above 9 billion euros <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is well achievable in the Private Bank. Asset <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Management, again a 2.5-billion-euro number was all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that I can see, well achievable. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So I think the stable business will be well in excess of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 19 billion euros. If you then think about the 28.5 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros, it's approximately 9 billion euros which we need <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from the Investment Bank. Now, again, I think James <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> said it in his prepared remarks, very strong business in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the Investment Bank. The episodic items which we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recorded in the first quarter of 2022, we always knew <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that this is not repeatable, but the underlying flow in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Investment Bank is strong. I just told you about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> additional investments which we did in Latin America <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and so on. I think what we need to achieve just in order <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to come to the 28.5 billion euros would be something <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> like 9 billion euros of revenues in the Investment Bank. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We took 2.7 billion euros in, that would mean on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> average, 2.1 billion euros quarterly, which we have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seen. And where I'm highly confident to get there, again <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> based on the momentum. Hence, the guidance stands <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and I'm confident. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On LCR, we'll always back-test. I think the industry, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> working with regulators, we'll back-test what we call the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outflow assumptions or the liquidity risk drivers. We'll <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> incorporate what we learn into our own internal models <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and discuss with regulators as an industry whether <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there are changes to LCR that are necessary. I'll tell you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that the experience of the last several years, the COVID <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> crisis in 2020, the impact of the inception of the war in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Ukraine last year, now the banking sector turbulence. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> All of those things have actually proven out, rather than <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> disprove, the severity of the liquidity risk drivers. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> feel really good about what the tool tells us. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> You mentioned the CDS market. We think CDS is an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> important risk management tool as well, helping banks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and counterparties manage credit risk. That said, it's an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> illiquid market, relatively speaking, and is prone to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 28 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> movements that may not reflect a realistic assessment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of default probability. I think it probably does bear some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> scrutiny, as to how that market works and whether <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there are ways to improve it. Let's be clear, I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> institutionally, and speaking personally, we think short <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> selling is a valuable activity. It provides information to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the marketplace and is not something that we would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> criticise in and of itself. The question is, is there a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> possibility for cross-talk between different part of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital structure that really doesn't represent <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> information in the market place? Hence, it's something <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that does bear some scrutiny. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As I say, we went through this period, which was an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> idiosyncratic focus, I think well. In a sense, we were <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> tested and we showed ourselves to be a strong, stable <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bank without the vulnerabilities that the market was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> concerned about. And, in a sense, that's a good thing, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that clients and investors and counterparties were able <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to see that. I'd probably leave it there, Tom. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Tom Hallett <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's very clear. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Anke Reingen <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you very much, good morning, for taking my <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (RBC) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> questions. The first is on costs, if you can talk a bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about the outlook and guidance. First with respect to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2023, Q1 that's running in line with the target of flat <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> adjusted and reported. If we look for the rest of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year, do you see any potential headwinds to your cost <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> target? You mentioned hiring, is there risk that we don't <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> end up on a flat adjusted and reported cost basis? And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in that respect, just confirming the 500 million euro <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> restructuring costs are incorporated in your flat cost <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guidance? Then if we travel from 2023 to 2025, is that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an essentially flat trajectory as well or when do the 2.5 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euro cost savings come through and other 500 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million euros, an additional cost saving in your cost path <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you modelled, or is it basically offsetting additional <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> headwinds you weren't seeing initially? Then the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cost/income ratio target, I realise you've made lots of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> progress, but still, 62.5% looks quite ambitious. What <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> levers do you think you can pull or where is the upside <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> potential from where we stand at the moment? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 29 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then second question is on loan losses, unchanged <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guidance of 25 to 30 basis points. Q1 is already 30 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> basis points and your assumption is avoiding a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recession in Germany, so how confident are you on your <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> loan loss provision guidance? Thank you very much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Anke, thank you for the questions. I'll dive in and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian may want to add. I'll go in reverse order, if I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> may. As we've talked about, the 372 million euros this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter is probably higher than we would've expected <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and, in particular focuses on around 120 million euros <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that we recognised on these two individual exposures <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the IPB. If you take that out, 250 million euros in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter is actually a sensible run-rate and would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> certainly deliver on the range and guidance that we've <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given. We're not seeing indicators, at this point, of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> weakness in credit. As we look at the forward-looking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> indicators, ratings movement, stage two events and all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the metrics we look at, we're just not seeing it yet. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are, obviously, mindful of the environment that we're in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and watching carefully, but to your question about do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the trends support the range, they do. We're <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> comfortable there. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The question on the path to 2025, on cost/income ratio. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What's the lever? The lever is operating leverage. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> highlighted back in February that the cumulative, if you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> like, the compound rate of operating leverage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> improvement over the four years from 2018 was 5% a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year. Now, we may not achieve that every year, but it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> doesn't take 5% a year to get us to 62.5% from 67%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And so, that's also why we've defined the strategy as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we have and why we define acceleration as we've done. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If we can find ways to accelerate revenue growth and at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> least manage the expense base flat with some of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> additional measures that we're taking, at least <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offsetting additional investments and hopefully brining <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a little bit more to the bottom line at that time. We think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the math to get to 62.5% is very solid. As Christian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outlined, we would hope to be able to make that a more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> easily achievable target and, as I say, potentially create <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> room for re-investment. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 30 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The 2023 path, as you say, are there headwinds? There <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are always headwinds. We are making investments, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> whether it's in technology or controls. We're seeing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> inflation and we need to work to offset those things. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The initiatives we announced today are not that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> meaningful in terms of 2023, so they might help us to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the tune of around 50 million in the back half of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year, but they step up over the next couple of years, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and so the run-rate of the various initiatives that we're <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> talking about, should achieve by 2025, or if not, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dribbling a little bit into 2026, would be about 250 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million euro. We think it's a meaningful contribution to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the 500 million euro goal that we have. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We're seeing a number of things, obviously, in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expense base we've talked about. We're going to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continue to fight through now in the second quarter, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> work hard to keep the company at that run-rate we've <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> talked about. In the second half we actually start to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> harvest some benefits of things we've been working on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for a while. I think notably, as we complete the Unity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> integration, while it doesn't immediately happen, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> start to harvest the benefits of that investment. We've <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> talked about the linearity and non-linearity of certain <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> elements of the 2 billion euros, so we will continue to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> work and harvest those. The short answer is, of course <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> it's always challenging to manage a company in an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment like this, with so many moving parts, to a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> run-rate, but we think we've got the tools and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> measures in place to do that and we've got an intense <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> amount of management focus on it. And, as Christian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> says, even more so with Rebecca's extended <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> responsibilities. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The only point I want to add, James said it all, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> potentially a number which helps you is the Q1 loan <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> loss provisions ex these two, in my view, idiosyncratic <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> items in the IPB was actually 21 basis points. That <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> helps you also, something about the robustness and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> solidity of Deutsche Bank's credit portfolio. With the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> statements James just made, that also going forward, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and the behaviour of our credit portfolios, we cannot <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 31 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> really see a negative development or a negative <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outlook. Hopefully this 21 basis points also gives you a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> little bit of guidance or comfort for our overall full-year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guidance. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Anke Reingen <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. If I may just come back to the cost path, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given some of the 2.5 billion euros is more back-end <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> loaded cost savings, the idea is still to be essentially flat <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> over 2023, 2024, 2025? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's right. Look, one thing, and I think it was <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> embedded in your question, I apologise. The <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> restructuring and severance is higher than we would've <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> planned for the year, that is true. In a sense, we've had <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an opportunity arise based on a lower-than-expected <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> single resolution fund assessment. We think we've been <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given an opportunity, even with that investment, to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> manage to the original guidance we gave you this year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Anke Reingen <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Anke. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Stuart Graham <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hi. Thanks for taking my question, I have two, please. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Autonomous) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The first is going back on the LCR. You set the 130% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> target some time ago, I guess what was a pre-Twitter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> world. And I think we've all been shocked at how quickly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> non-sticky retail and corporate deposits can move <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> nowadays. Given the power of social media, don't you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think that 130% needs to be higher nowadays? That's' <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the first question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The second question is on US commercial real estate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> office exposure. Thank you for the extra granularity on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> slide 15, that's really, really useful. Could I also ask, how <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> much of that 4.5-billion-euro book is criticised and what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> your stock of loan loss amounts on that book are, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> please? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure, Stuart. It's early days, with respect to LCR and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> items that you mentioned. Yes, we've learnt a painful <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lesson about the speed at which information and, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> arguably, in some cases, misinformation travel in a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> social media world and the relatively frictionless <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> movement of funds that we have. I think the important <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 32 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lesson is confidence in banking institutions is critical. I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think that confidence arises from banks getting the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> basics right, and we think we've got the basics right at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Deutsche Bank. Those are stable deposit basis and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> funding, managing risks carefully, ensuring that you're <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> really adding value for clients, you have a sustainable <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business model. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> All of these elements, does it affect how you think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about LCR? I think LCR is misunderstood, in the sense <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that it is very conservative. And because the banks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have chosen, since it was introduced to manage to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> buffers, that there's room in that ratio. I think it's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> important to understand, if a bank hits 100% that, in our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> case, we have now 43% margin against the 100%, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at 100% we're still able to withstand a 30-day stress <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and come out standing. So, it's a conservatively <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> constructed ratio. You have to remember, also, that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> things that flow off the balance sheet affect both the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> numerator and the denominator, so you have this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dynamic nature of the ratio on the way down. There's a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> number of interesting features about that tool that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would suggest as it is, it's a very powerful stability <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driver in the industry. That doesn't mean we won't <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> examine it, we won't examine individual risk drivers, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> my hope is that a combination of the basics and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> tools we have today put us in a good place. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Stuart Graham <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In theory, if the Basel Committee chose to recalibrate it, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you could run with a lower buffer, it wouldn't have to be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 130%, it might be 110% on a more conservatively <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stated LCR. I know it's a theoretical discussion. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Theoretically, yes. And we're mindful, Stuart, that there <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is a cost to holding these buffers. Our shareholders, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> essentially, are paying for that buffer. It needs to be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there, let's be clear. The sustainability of a bank which <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is engaged in maturity transformation relies on that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> buffer being there, but you want to calibrate it to a level <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that protects safety and soundness in essentially all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> market conditions. But then isn't so inefficient that it's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an unreasonable tax on shareholders. That balance is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an interesting one and I think we need to continue to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 33 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> examine. In general, by the way, since the crisis, banks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have behaviour of preserving buffers. Banks manage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> now not just with buffers, but with a disincentive to see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> buffers used. I think that whole edifice in a sense, can <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be discussed and examined. But, I just want to draw a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> line under it, in a positive way, the stability and the tools <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and post-crisis regulation, I think, should be understood <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> as a success based on what we've learned over the past <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> eight weeks, rather than the opposite. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Briefly on commercial real estate, we don't actually look <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at it in US terms around criticised necessarily in our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> IFRS accounting. But what I can tell you is that 1.6 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euros, so a little bit more than a third, would be in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stages 2 and 3. We're not saying we're immune. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think we're well underwritten, we have a stable <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> portfolio. We think project by project we're in good <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> shape, given the market environment. But there, of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> course, are loans, maybe 600 million euros of that 1.6 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euros, that we're looking at carefully and need to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> work with the sponsors around extension dates and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> refinancings, to make sure it carries through this market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment, without more scratches and bruises. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Stuart Graham <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And the stock of provisions on that book? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Stock of provisions is I think in total around probably 50 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> million euro against the stage 3, not against the 1.6 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euro, but against the stage 3. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Stuart Graham <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Got it. Thank you very much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Stuart. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Nicolas Payen <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, I have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Kepler Cheuvreux) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> two. The first one would be on the revenue path going <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> into 2024. You mentioned that we might have seen the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> peak in terms of interest rates repricing, you have a bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of deposit shift and increase in beta, as well as slowing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> growth in mortgages and loans in general. What do you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think about revenues going into 2024? The second <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> question, sorry to come back on the idiosyncratic event <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of March, but as you mentioned, you have a strong <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> liquidity buffer, conservative risk management, and yet, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 34 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you are one of the most banks under pressure from <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stock price point of view in March. What can you do to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> change the perception about the riskiness and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stronger fundamentals of DB? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Revenue path, I'll make a couple of comments, Christian <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will, I'm sure, add. I'll start with the Investment Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> because that's where investors tend to start. I don't <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think we're at a point of peak revenue potential in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Investment Bank because just if you think about where <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we are, for example right now in origination and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> advisory, that's still recovering. So, we think there's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> scope to improve there. As Christian mentioned, I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we've got scope to invest in that area and improve our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> market shares, leave aside the market wallet <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> performance. Financing is doing quite well, both in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> volume for market opportunity terms and in spreads. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then I think our Markets businesses have been strong <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> performers and also risk managers. Of course, in that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business we're going to ride a little bit the volatility and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the volume in the marketplace, but we feel good about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the way the business has come together under Ram's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> leadership. All of those things would tell us we can at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> last sustain and perhaps improve on the Investment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian mentioned earlier, the Private Bank still has a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> way to run, in terms of the momentum that interest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> rates deliver, let alone assets under management, loan <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and deposit growth, and in the case of loans, loans <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outside of mortgages. So we feel comfortable there's a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> good path there. We're probably past peak lag, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we're not past the generalised improvement in the rate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment in Corporate Bank. Lastly, I think, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Asset Management business, by executing the plan <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Stefan Hoops has laid out, has a clear path to growth in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets, obviously it will ride the market a little bit, but is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> also not anywhere near its peak revenue potential. All of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> those things I think feed into 2024 and then 2025, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there is sustainable momentum built into that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Your second question was liquidity and margin, what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> can we do? We're acutely aware that, I don't think, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 35 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> were singled out uniquely, but we were in a group that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> were potentially perceived as vulnerable to the issues <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that arose. As I said earlier, it's gratifying that the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> market can very quickly identify that those <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> vulnerabilities did not exist with us or, frankly, our peers <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in Europe, that might otherwise have also come into <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pressure. I think the answer to your question is the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more we execute on our strategy, the more we deliver <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sustainable profitability, but also, the more we put <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> historical issues around control failures and other <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> events in the past, I hope that, what some call muscle <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> memory, will fade in the market, and the beta nature of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Deutsche Bank will fade. As a management team, I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think we're all very committed to achieving that goal. It <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lies in our hands, to some extent, around execution, it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lies in investors' hands, in terms of their support for our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> securities. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Nicolas Payen <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Adam Terelak <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Morning, thank you for the questions. I have one on NII <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Mediobanca) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and one on capital. Could you give us a little bit of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> update on the NII trajectory? From here, clearly, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expectation on rates have gone up, but also, deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> beta seems to be low. Just a bit of colour on both sides <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of the balance sheet there and what that means for this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year's guidance. And just to add, what your deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assumptions are from here, within that guidance, for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> full-year 2023 and beyond. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then secondly, on capital. Christian, you mentioned the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 15 to 20 billion euro of RWA relief. I just want to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> understand your guys' thinking on how to redeploy that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2+ billion euros, potentially, of capital unlocked. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Whether that's going to go back into the balance sheet, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> what businesses would be grossed in or what decisions <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would come to returning that to shareholders, as you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> mentioned. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Finally, just a clarification. On Q4 2022 you were talking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about the regulatory inflation to come with offsets. Is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the market risk benefit you've taken this quarter the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offsetting item that we discussed in previous quarters? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 36 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Adam, I'm not sure I followed all the questions, but let <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> me start with NII trajectory. What I'd do is refer you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> back to page 26 of the February 2nd, 2022 materials. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We're not going to update the NII trajectory every <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter, but I would say that the assumptions there on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> page 26 are still pretty good assumptions. There are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> always movements up and down in how NII will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> perform. But this idea that we would put on at that time <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 900 million euros, I think it's actually a little bit better <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> than 900 million euros, given assumptions have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> improved relative to our expectations at that time, this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year, is still a really good assumption. We did 13.65 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> billion euros of net interest income last year, if that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> grew by a billion euros or more, that would be a good <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assumption. There might be a plateau or even a small <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> dip in 2024 and then, as you see, there's another leg up <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in 2025, as the interest rate characteristics in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Private Bank come through. I think that guidance still <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> holds. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now one thing, just to advise you, if you look at interest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> income in Q1 and attempt to annualise it, you won't get <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to that number precisely because, as we highlight, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there's been a swing in the characteristic of the revenue <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recognition. Think of it a little bit like trading NIM in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> US banks. More of the revenue were characterised as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fair value through P&L in Q1 than would be typical, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we can get into the reasons for that. Don't be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> concerned that there's any difference in the guidance <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from that anomaly, we're very comfortable with the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guidance that we've given and actually, at the moment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we're seeing, based on the curve and the funding <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profile, a little bit of upside to our earlier guidance. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Adam, on your capital question. One thing is clear, if <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you see market opportunities, like I tried to describe it, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> obviously some of the RWA optimisations we would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> certainly reinvest into the one or the other business. But <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clearly, we also believe that with the increased <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profitability which we expect and with that capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> efficiency, which we outlined on page seven. And, by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 37 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the way, again, this has not been only a top-down, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bottom-up analysis, which we even curtailed a bit top <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> down, so there is real potential. Of course, we will think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about how much of these additional savings we can <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> also hand back to our shareholders. I think if you ask me <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> today, it will be a combination of a reinvestment into <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> those businesses which are really then capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> rewarding and where we have a very good story for our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> shareholders and investors, but part of that will also be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given back to the shareholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Maybe just to build on that, what Christian said, to give <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you a bit more specific guidance. If I look at the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> consensus RWA number for 2025, which is 422 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros, without wanting to get pinned down to specific <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> number because, as Christian says, it's quite dynamic. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Think of the 15 to 20 billion euros as being a net <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reduction from that guidance. We would expect, based <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on everything we know right now, to be somewhere in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the low 400s, 400 to 410 billion euros, so that can give <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you a sense if you're building your model based on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> organic revenue generation, the Basel III impact that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we've talked about, of about 30 billion euros of RWA, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> gives you a little bit of a sense of where it can provide, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at the very least, additional support for the capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> trajectory that we've laid out already. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Adam Terelak <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Right, thank you. The final point was whether the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> regulatory tailwind you've had this quarter was the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offsetting item we've discussed against the modelling. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> No. The one item we talked about was a market risk <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> RWA item. That was in the plan but is not part of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> net 40 to 60 basis points that I talked about earlier. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Adam Terelak <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay, very clear. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Kian Abouhossein <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (JPMorgan) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> general question. If I look at the turnaround of the bank, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and I think Berlin should send you two medals, both to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian and James, the market is clearly thinking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> differently. You're trading at 0.3 times tangible book, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 38 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you're trading at five times, roughly, this year's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> earnings, so there's a disconnect. And I'm just trying to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> understand how you're going to bridge that disconnect <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and if there's going to be any change, in the sense that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you're going to communicate maybe at an Investor Day <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> or any other measures, that you feel are understood, in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> particular, that we and investors should be thinking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The second question is I'm quite interested in some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management changes that you have announced. You <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have Rebecca Short being the COO and also being <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> responsible for cost, besides the transformation. Just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> wondering if there's any change in your thinking around <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cost? It feels like there is from the language, but just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> wondering if there's any, so 500 million euros, but I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> wonder if there's any change in the way we should think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about Deutsche and cost management going forward <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> now, relative to last year? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Kian. Let me try to start and James will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> jump in. It's always hard to talk yourself about why we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are perceived in the market as we are perceived. This is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> actually a question I would like to always hand back to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you guys, that you tell us what we can do better in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> communicating. I give you three items, and one of that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is not meant in any defensive way. But I do believe that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> if you just think 14 months back, where we stood in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> February 2022 before this awful war broke out. I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at some point in time we were at a share price around <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 14.30 euros or something like that. Not that this would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be our ultimate goal, as you know, but you could see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that people started to think that this is going into the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> right direction. Now I still believe that the overall <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> uncertainty and the geopolitical uncertainty is a drag <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for us and that we're still suffering from that. That is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> point number one. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Point number two is clearly that we have to show, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we also hear it on this call, I think it's only delivery, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you have two very resilient people here on this call. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will drive this resilience and we will show you, quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> by quarter, week by week, month by month and day by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 39 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> day, that we keep the ship exactly in this direction. But <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the composition of Deutsche Bank, of the revenues, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> completely changed. We have 66% of revenue from the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Corporate Bank, Private Bank and Asset Management. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> If you would listen to me for another two hours, I can <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> tell you these revenues in these businesses only have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> one direction. The 66% will be the ratio, potentially it <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> even goes into an even more favourable number, if you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think about a stable versus less stable business, it even <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> goes into an even more favourable number. We have a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bank which now that balance, that's stable from a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profitability, from a sustainability of revenues, that I'm <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> very, very confident that we can show quarter by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter a very sustainable development. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To the Investment Bank, to be honest, and again <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> potentially we need to do a better job, and I'm the first <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> one who tries to learn, but I think the inner stability of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the Investment Bank was all the changes we have done <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> over the last four years is far stronger than potentially <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the market thinks about it. James just talked about the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Financing business, a very stable business. I think it's a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Financing business in the Investment Bank which is, in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> my view, among the top three in the world, also from an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> underwriting standard. If you think about the value <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> chain, from the first line of defence to the second line of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> defence, I think it's a business where even others <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outside of Deutsche Bank are saying, this is top <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business. That is a business which is continuously <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> above 3 billion euros of revenues. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have re-configurated the trading business Ram <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Nayak to one of the leading trading businesses. Again, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> if you look at Q1 and take out the episodic items, I'm <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> just mentioning the ZIM name which we talked about in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2021 and 2022 a lot, which obviously is not something <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which comes back every quarter. Then the underlying <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business in the Investment Bank in 2023 in the first <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter was actually even stronger than in the first <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter of 2022, despite it was a very strong quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We will see now a comeback in the O&A business in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Investment Bank. We do some selective investments <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 40 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there because we see the market opportunities and we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will be awake for these market opportunities, so that I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think you have three very stable businesses, with the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> interest rates still to come in one of our largest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> businesses, which is the Private Bank, with revenues <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clearly above 9 billion euros. I think from a pure revenue <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> point of view, this bank is completely turned around and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we are playing there where the clients want us to play <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and where we see the momentum. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Secondly, on the cost side, yes, we are now in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> second phase, and I'm grateful for your question, Kian, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of real cost takeout. That is a cost takeout which now <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> goes, in particular, front to back, that we see the revised <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> processes where we have invested a lot in the front <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offices, which now need to go into the infrastructure <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> because we need one process from the origination to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the infrastructure. And for that, we decided that all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> COOs in the infrastructure functions are now sub- <LINEBREAK> summarised under Rebecca's lead, so that we can do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the changes in one process, from the front office into <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the various infrastructure functions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Secondly, when you have invested so much into <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> controls, and we keep doing this, at some point in time, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> obviously automation and machine learning, artificial <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> intelligence, but in particular automation, will also lead <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> over time to reduced costs. Unity will pay off, as we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> said. What you now see in the second phase of taking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> costs out, it's not like in the first stage, that we exited <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> businesses and we took those costs out, but it's actually <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the smart takeout of costs plus a constant review, also <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of our workforce, where we need to do something. The <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reduction in force action is something which we have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> done now and I'm sure we'll do similar things in 2024, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 2025 again, that is a constant review of our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> organisation. That's all now under Rebecca and I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with one person driving that, we will even have more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> force on it. I think it's a normal development in trends <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> forming in an organisation, but with the robustness and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> resilience of the revenues and that discipline on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cost management, I do believe that we will show now, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 41 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter by quarter, year by year, that this bank is on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> right track. And at some point in time, I'm sure that also <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the investors will see that. If this is then joined by, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> hopefully, and this is the most important we should all <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> look at, that this awful war comes to an end at some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> point in time, I think than also Europe will be seen <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> differently and then later, then we will have relief from <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that side. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Amit Goel <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hi, thank you. I've got two questions, actually follow- <LINEBREAK> (Barclays) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ups. One, I'm just trying to gauge the size of potential <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> share buybacks in the second half. If I use the maths <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you were talking about, it suggests 13.6% to 13.2% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> CET1 ratio, 40 bps, so 1.4 billion euros for buybacks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> growth and other things. But then obviously the last <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> buyback was about 300 million euros, so I'm just trying <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to get a sense of your thinking, or have you asked for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> numbers in the 750 to 1 billion euro range or is it closer <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to what was previously done? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then the second question, just a follow-up on the LCR <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio. In the end, I'm just wondering, are you going to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continue to target 130% and trend down towards that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> level or are you going to look to keep the LCR similar to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> where it is today? Do you have a benefit in your plan on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> revenues for bringing that LCR down to 130%? Thank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Amit. Your math is right, the 40 basis points <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would represent something a little shy of 1.5 billion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euro, so use 1.5 billion euro. As Christian indicated, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> look at last year's buyback at 300 million euro and, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given the progress we've made, and, by the way, I don't <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> want to be committed to a specific number, a specific <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> timing, and it's too early, obviously, we need to go <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> through this with the supervisors in presenting a new <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital plan. But a step forward on last year's number <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would be consistent with the guidance or the capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> planning that we shared with you back in March of last <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year. As Christian mentioned, to maybe give you a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sense of ranging then, a 50% increase in dividend, if <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that was mirrored also with the increase of the buyback <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of a similar amount, it would give you a sense of a range <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 42 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of what we think might be sought by us. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I will say that, given the starting point of the 40 basis <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> points, that's why we think this type of ask would be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> affordable. There's uncertainties in the environment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> where you would expect us to remain prudent, but as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we say, with the buffers we have, we think we have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> space for something like that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In LCR, we were very conscious as we went through Q1 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that we had a high print at the end of December. That <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> was, frankly, and accident. The average last quarter and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the average this quarter are both almost exactly where <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you'd want it to be, in this low 130% range. If we're <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> targeting 130%, then you'd expect us to be a little bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> higher than 130%. I think for this quarter, we'd probably <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> target a gentle decline. We are mindful that the risks in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the outlook haven't entirely abated, but I wouldn't want <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you to be surprised if the number started with 130% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> when we're talking with each other again in July. As to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the cost of that buffer, obviously it does play a role, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> it is very dynamic, so I wouldn't tie a specific revenue, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> better or worse, number to a ratio, better or worse, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> view. I hope that helps. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Amit Goel <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. Much appreciated. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Amit. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Sigee <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. I'll try to be quick, it's a couple of follow-ups <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (BNP) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on capital management. The first is on balance sheet, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which often has grown seasonally in Q1. With full-year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> results you said that again you expected it to this year, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> but it hasn't, it shrunk slightly in Q1. I just wondered <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> how much of that was deliberate, deliberately steering <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the balance sheet smaller in a choppy environment, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> versus lack of opportunity to deploy. That's my first <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then my second question, really just on the capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> surpluses uses, etc. Is 13% CET1 or 13.2%, is that still <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the right reference level in a world where the market is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> nervous? Not just the market, but the world more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> broadly is nervous around banks. And there's things like <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 43 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Basel IV to be funded, some banks are prefunding that, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> etc. Is 13% still the right reference level to be talking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about for capital? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy, I'll go in reverse order. Remember that in our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital plan we will be building to Basel III final <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> framework. And in this plan, because of the model <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> adjustments, higher LGD floors and various items, that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 13.2% has been getting steadily more conservative in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> how we're capitalising our risks. We do think it's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> appropriate to continue to target that level. As you say, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there'll be a bubble in 2024 that goes away on January <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 1, 2025, all things equal, that we need to build into our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> planning. But we feel comfortable with the buffer at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 200 basis points above MDA. As I say, it's getting more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> conservative steadily. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On capital management and the deliberate nature, to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be fair, it actually wasn't deliberate. Are we looking at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> risk appetite carefully and extensions of balance sheet <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in this environment? Of course. But actually, the usual <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seasonality was a little bit less than we might otherwise <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have expected, both on leverage exposure and RWA. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And we do think loan growth is probably a little slower <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the coming quarters than we might've expected, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given credit conditions, the possibility of recession and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> all of the features in the environment today. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jeremy Sigee <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's very helpful, thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Jeremy. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Piers Brown <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Good morning. Just a follow-up on funding, if I may. It's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (HSBC) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> probably more a question for the fixed income call, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'll ask it anyway. You've given some very good <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transparency around deposit flows, pre and post the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> events in March. I wonder if you can just give any <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> commentary on what you see in wholesale funding <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> markets? I think you were saying around the March <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> event's time you had about 50% of the funding planned <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for this year done, most of that was coming in senior <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> non-preferred and covered bonds, but have you been <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> able to access the markets post those events? And are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> spreads getting back to some sort of acceptable level? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 44 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then, if you've got any thoughts just on longer-term <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> issues around AT1 and the viability of that market, that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> would be very helpful as well. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Piers, happy to take it. Richard is with me in the room <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> here and we look forward to talking with our fixed <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> income investors tomorrow, but nice to have fixed <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> income topics on the equity call. We came into the year, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> as we mentioned, cautious about the environment. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> When we saw the market opening in the first few weeks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of the year, we decided to move quickly, much quicker <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> than our original funding plan might've suggested. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> were pleased to have done all that, not just senior non- <LINEBREAK> preferred, by the way, but we did covered and we did a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Tier 2 issue before the end of February. And we'd done <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an AT1 deal late last year, which might look like <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expensive capital, but gave us real comfort traveling <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> into an uncertain 2023, that we were making the right <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> decisions for the bank. We haven't really gone to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> market since the turbulence started in any meaningful <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> way. I think we may have done a covered bond in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> interim. But the reason is not because we don't have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> access to it, but we don't like the price and pre-funding, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> therefore, was economically sensible and has actually <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> given us, to the earlier question from Adam on the path <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of net interest income, I think, a slightly better funding <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profile for this year and going into 2024, than we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> might've expected. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On AT1, we think the market healed more quickly than <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we might've expected after that Sunday. The <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> instrument had challenges at inception, as the market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> was being created, and I think it has now established a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> good convention with good investor understanding of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> what the various triggers and what have you are, in it. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And I think it'll survive in this form. It conceivably will be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a little bit more expensive for banks to issue AT1 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> securities, and I think it's worth a look at that, but our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sense is that it'll continue to be a viable instrument <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> going forward for us. Again, given we were <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> conservative around our issuance profile. We don't have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a call date until 2025 and, as I say, we're in a good place <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 45 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on our funding plan for this year. We feel overall very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> constructive about where we stand and our hope and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expectation is spreads will narrow again in the coming <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> months. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Piers Brown <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's very clear. Thank you very much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Piers. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jon Peace <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. Just in the interest of time, maybe Christian, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Credit Suisse) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I could ask you a high-level question. What would be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> your view of how regulators respond to the liquidity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> concerns of March? And would you see a risk of higher <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for longer deposit guarantee fund contributions? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Christian Sewing <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Always hard to imagine and to think about what a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> potential reaction could be. But I think, first of all, in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> particular the European regulators should also think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> back and look back at the March events and claim that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a lot of things they have done, we have done, have been <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> right. Because I think the European banking system <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> showed stability resilience, and I think credit to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> regulators for that, what they have done. I think this is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for the number one lesson learnt. If you start from that, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I think there is no reason to now come up with a, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> whatever you call it, knee-jerk reaction, to think about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> further rules. To be very honest, I think the discussions <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we have also after these events are done in a very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> constructive way. That everybody looks at potential <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> loopholes still, or weaknesses, that is clear and I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this should be done, like we do it, if something is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happening on our side. But I can tell you that these <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> discussions are really constructive and I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> regulators, in particular in Europe, should look back and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seeing a very stable system. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In this regard, I also do hope that from a SRF point of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> view, from a deposit scheme and from a single <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> resolution fund, that we don't see a different direction. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> To be honest, I'm not hearing this. Again, one should <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> also not only think about the single resolution fund, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> also that we have national schemes which worked in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the past. Hence, I think again, I see regulators, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 46 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> politicians being very calm, being very constructive, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I hope it's the case going forward. Hence, I'm calm on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Jon Peace <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Great. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Coombs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Good morning. One, if I could just come back to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Citi) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> LCR, but just a very simple number of questions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Related to TLTRO, you've obviously prepaid down. Can <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you tell us how much you paid back, what your <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outstanding balance is and what the LCR would be on a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> pro forma basis ex the TLTRO? That's the first <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Second question, some strength in the Corporate Bank, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in particular when you look at the strength of CTS and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ICS, if you could break down how much of that is purely <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driven by rates versus how much is momentum on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> volumes and other initiatives that you're taking? I would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> love your thoughts there, given the strength in that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> division this quarter. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew, on the LCR, I think maybe we'll come back <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> tomorrow in the fixed income call. I think by memory, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we paid down seven billion euros of the TLTRO. What <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happens is TLTRO rolls into the LCR window over time, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> so it is still there. There's a nuance in it, which has to do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with what collateral is posted in the TLTRO programme <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> versus unencumbered. It is a support to ratio, but one <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that we have a funding plan to wean ourselves off over <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> time. It actually does give us some flexibility in how we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> manage collateral across the bank. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In CB, in round numbers, we were flattish on fees and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> commission, a little bit up. Volumes were, depending on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> whether you're looking year-on-year or quarter-on- <LINEBREAK> quarter, flat to up slightly. What you get is right now a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> significant impact of rates and, within rates, the lag. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Obviously, what you'd like to see is growth in both <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> volumes and transactions, if you like, fee and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> commission, increasing as the lag effect begins to run <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> off. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Coombs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And presumably, the guidance you gave at Q4 for the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 47 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Group, where you talked about more significant deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> migration flowing through in 2024 versus 2023, would <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be very much the same for the Corporate Bank. So, to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> some extent you're expecting revenues to peak out this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year and then stabilise. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Yes, I think that's fair. What remains to be seen is how <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the fee, commission and volume effect offsets the run- <LINEBREAK> off of the lag benefit and over what period of time. As I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think we talked about in February, there's also a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> hedging benefit in time. As certain hedges roll off there <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is a step up later in 2024, from particularly dollar <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> hedges rolling off, so there's still some juice in the rate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> environment for CB as well. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Coombs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Brilliant, thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Andrew. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Vishal Shah <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hi. Thank you so much for your presentation. I just have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Morgan Stanley) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a few quick questions. One, can I go back to the CRE <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> exposures. In your previous presentations I also noted <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you have this additional 15 billion euros in real estate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> exposures, which is recourse <MULTISPACE> lending. Could you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> provide some clarity on the nature of that remaining <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> portfolio? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Secondly, on the LTVs, could you clarify if these LTVs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you provide in the presentation are origination or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are they your assumptions in terms of what they should <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> look like now? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then, lastly, on the deposits, could you talk a bit about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> how the beta has been evolving between Retail and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Corporates, a bit of colour on the mix shifts and also, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> how is Deutsche Bank reacting to competition in terms <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of repricing? Thank you so much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sure, happy, Vishal, to answer the questions. There's a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> lot in that recourse lending portfolio. There can be, for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> example, senior revolvers to real estate investment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> trusts, there can be working capital, sometimes <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> construction lending to corporates that are recourse in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> nature, but where you have a lien on property. There's a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> bunch of things there. Also, by the way, wealth <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 48 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> management, where you'd be lending to wealthy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> individuals who are investing in either their own <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> businesses or in commercial real estate investments on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> their part. In terms of the nature, the riskiness, if you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> like, and the underlying exposure, it is very different to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the non-recourse portfolio. Hence, our own focus <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> versus the rest portfolio distinction. The losses in those <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> portfolios have been negligible, historically, just <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> negligible. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On the LTVs, what we provide is the most recent. Our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> practice is to have external valuations no less frequently <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> than once a year. Our internal views are updated no less <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> frequently than every six months, so you do get, if not a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> real-time, there's of course a little bit of a lag in that, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you get relatively speaking LTVs that adjust over time. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> Your beta development question is an interesting one. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We look at it both by currency and by portfolio. As <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you'd expect, the dollar has moved more quickly and I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think is catching up with the models more quickly. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Getting, I would argue, close on the retail side to what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we might've expected, and closer on Corporate. The <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euro is lagging that in both cases, considerably, based <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> both on the recency of the rate increases and I think <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> just the nature and structure of the European deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and funding market. The euro continues to outperform, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> again, across both portfolios. While that data also has a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> little bit of a lag in it, looking at March right now, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> turbulence that the industry went through, I think it had <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an impact, but I wouldn't say it was a dramatic impact, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at least in our estimation, on that beta trajectory. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Vishal Shah <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you so much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Vishal. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Lim <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just have a few <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (Societe Generale) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quick-fire questions. Firstly, you gave the percentage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits that are insured for your German retail deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> base. What does that look like on a Group basis, when <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you take into account the larger, corporate deposits? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then secondly, for your Group NIM, I guess that's 1.6% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 49 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on an adjusted basis, how does your Group NII, how <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> should that develop with respect to the hedge gains <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you've also had in the coming quarters and do you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have an expectation for that Group NIM and how that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> should develop going forward? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Then lastly, in a post-TRIM world, why is Deutsche <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank having a 40 to 60 basis point hit on the CET1 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ratio, largely due to a review of internal modelling? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew, thank you for sticking with us. Sorry that the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> questions are coming so late in the call. Let me start <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with the NIM. I'm always a little bit cautious about <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> predicting NIMs because there's so many moving parts <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in it, but in round numbers, if you take our guidance <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from the beginning of the year, which would've led you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to the mid-14s, maybe a little better, and interest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> earning assets of somewhere a little bit below 1 trillion <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> euros, you'd probably be in the 150 basis point range. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Again, subject to some swings on the characterisation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that I mentioned. We do provide, as always, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profitability by segments, including both net interest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> revenues and fair value through profit and loss. So you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> see that the total profitability, if you like, that the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> balance sheet produces, with that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of the deposit base, the total deposit base, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> numbers we gave you I think were 33% of the total <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposit base under statutory insurance, 41% if you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> exclude banks from that. I think to your question, what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is the German deposit base in total, is that right? And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that's a number I don't have to hand, I'd have to get <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> back to you on, if that was the question you're after. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Lim <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's the total Group deposit base, but I can chase that up <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with you tomorrow. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The total Group deposit base is 33% then and 41% if <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you exclude banks from that ratio. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Lim <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Great, thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Andrew. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Lim <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sorry, lastly, on the impacts due to internal modelling, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 50 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> it's something quite specific to Deutsche Bank, it's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> maybe surprising in a post-TRIM world. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The post-TRIM world is really characterised by some of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the EBA guidance that came out and the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> implementation of that. And it particularly relates to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> LGDs, to a lesser extent some of the other factors. It's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> been rolling through the portfolio, so we did see some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in retail last year and, as we've talked about, more next <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> year. It hasn't been uniquely to either the Investment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Bank or the Corporate Bank, but it's gone portfolio by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> portfolio. There will be some implementation of new <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> models in the aftermath of our Unity technology <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> implementation. There's a dependency there, so there <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will be some adjustments in the models that are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> implemented then in Q3, also on the Private Bank side. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I believe that by the end of the year then, we will have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> been through the reviews that we need to with the ECB, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and implemented what there is to do. 2024 should be a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cleaner year and give us the ability to prepare by then <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for Basel III final framework implementation on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> January1, 2025. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Andrew Lim <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> That's great, thank you very much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> James von Moltke <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks, Andrew. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Silke-Nicole Szypa <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you very much for your questions.
