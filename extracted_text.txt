Ermotti <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 3 - Key Messages <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Sarah, good morning, everyone. I am happy to be back here with all of you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And it is an honor and privilege to lead UBS once again, especially at such a pivotal time for our organization <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and for all our stakeholders. First of all, I'd like to thank Ralph, the management team and all of our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> employees for their dedication over the last two and a half years. During this time, UBS delivered record <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> results and continued to build trust and confidence with our clients and our stakeholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Our performance this quarter demonstrates that we continue to be a source of stability for our clients during <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> periods of significant uncertainty. Our strong flows across Global Wealth Management and Asset <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Management reflect our clients' continued confidence and trust in us. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The results include an increase in litigation provisions relating to U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are in advanced discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice, and I am pleased that we are making <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> progress towards resolving this legacy matter that dates back 15 years. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On an underlying basis, which also excludes litigation, our results were solid, with a return on CET1 capital of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 16.5% and a cost-to-income ratio of 72.8%. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> When I left UBS in 2020, our strength and stability put us in a position to consider all options for our future, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> including transformative acquisitions. Today, UBS is stronger than ever, with diversified revenue streams, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continued capital and liquidity strength, disciplined risk management, and a balance sheet for all seasons. As <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> a result, we are well prepared to be part of the solution to rescue Credit Suisse and contribute to financial <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stability in Switzerland and globally. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Despite its complexity, I am convinced that this transaction will also provide value for the clients and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> employees of the combined organization. The acquisition enables us to benefit from the significant franchise <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> value, and in many cases, complementary businesses within Credit Suisse. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 2 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 4 - Our clients turned to us as they searched for stability <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> For our clients, the first quarter was largely a continuation of the themes from 2022. Clients continue to be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> concerned about the impact that inflation and central bank policy will have on economic growth, especially in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the U.S. While our wealth management clients remained on the sidelines, our advisors helped them identify <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> opportunities to manage their liquidity and diversify risks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As a result, we benefited from 20 billion dollars in net new fee-generating assets globally, an annualized growth <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> rate of 6%. Net new money in GWM was 28 billion. Importantly, 7 billion of this came in the ten business days <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> after the acquisition announcement. This is a further testament to how clients turn to us as they search for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stability. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> During the first quarter, we helped our clients diversify cash holdings as they shifted deposits into money market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> funds and T-Bills. In Asset Management, we saw another 18 billion dollars in money market inflows, with strong <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> contributions from our U.S. wealth management clients. We saw further deleveraging, particularly in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Americas, but also in APAC and EMEA. This was offset by loan growth in Switzerland, resulting in stable loan <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> balances quarter-on-quarter, excluding FX. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Compared to last year's very strong first quarter, institutional clients were less active, particularly in equity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> derivatives and cash as they lacked conviction in an uncertain market. However, we did have strong <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> performances in Prime Brokerage and electronic FX. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 5 - Continued client momentum with positive net new money in all regions <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Clients continue to turn to us for advice in managing their assets, including their liquidity. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What is important is deposit shifts into money markets and T-bills remained with UBS and we also saw <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 9 billion in new deposits into our platform. This supported positive net new money across all of our regions in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the first quarter. Let me go through each of the regions in more detail. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In the Americas, our Separately Managed Account initiative with Asset Management further supported net <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> new fee-generating assets. And during the period of significant disruption in March, we saw positive inflows <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from our clients. As a result, we had solid net new money for the quarter. Our advisor recruiting momentum <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> also continued and should support flows in future periods, aligned with our continued growth ambitions in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the U.S. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The strength of our business in Switzerland resulted in another quarter of inflows into mandates and other <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> investment products. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In EMEA, clients continue to be cautious overall, but net new money was positive, and net interest income <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> rose by nearly 60% as we started to benefit from higher Euro rates. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Lastly, while our clients in Asia Pacific continued to take a wait-and-see approach in terms of transactions, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> saw broad-based flows into net new fee-generating assets. We have now seen 17% net new fee-generating <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> asset growth in APAC over the last twelve months. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 3 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 6 - Enhancing client franchises through the announced acquisition of Credit Suisse <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> When I first became UBS's Group CEO in 2011, we positioned our asset gathering and Swiss businesses at the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> heart of our strategy. We successfully restructured our Investment Bank by reducing non-core markets activities <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and assets with discipline. We solidified our capital position. And we took decisive actions to strengthen our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> culture. As a result of our efforts, we restored trust with all our stakeholders, materially de-risked our business <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and generated significant amounts of capital for our shareholders. As we now embark on another <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transformational step in UBS's journey, our principles will remain the same. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We will be laser-focused on delivering the best possible outcome for our unrivaled client franchises, our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> employees, our shareholders and for all of Switzerland. We will do this by maintaining our strong culture and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> focus on prudent risk management. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The combination of UBS and Credit Suisse will result in around 5 trillion of invested assets, which is the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> equivalent for us of 7 to 10 years of net new money. It will make us the second largest wealth manager in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> world. Importantly, it will reinforce our position as the only truly global player among the leading wealth <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> managers with strategic scale and complementary capabilities in the most attractive growth markets. We will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reinforce our leading position in APAC, Switzerland and EMEA and will significantly enhance our position in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Latin America. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Asset Management, the combination will improve our positioning globally and in Europe. But more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> importantly, we will bring together two highly complementary businesses to increase our scale and accelerate <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our strategic growth plans. With the combination, our clients will benefit from an enhanced offering in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Alternatives, Credit and Thematics, with additional scale for our Index platform. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We are already the leading bank in Switzerland. This is not a result of our size or market share, but our expert <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capabilities and the global reach we provide our clients. The combination with Credit Suisse will reinforce these <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strengths. There is strong competition in the Swiss market. For example, the combined market share of UBS <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and Credit Suisse in mortgages and in loans to corporates and public institutions is lower than that of the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> cantonal banks. Raiffeisen has twice as many branches as UBS and Credit Suisse combined. So, customers have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> plenty of options and we will have to work hard to earn and retain their relationships. As we think about the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> future of this business, my commitment is that we will look at the best option to create most value for both <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> franchises in the interest of our clients, employees, shareholders and society at large. This assessment will be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> based on facts, not emotions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Globally, we will stay true to our capital-light and client-focused investment bank model, which we will leverage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> across the organization while benefiting from diversification and complementary capabilities. As a result, the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Investment Bank will account for around 25% of Group risk weighted assets on day-1 and beyond. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Activities outside of our strategic focus and risk appetite will be run-down in the best interests of our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> shareholders while minimizing the risk of potential losses to the Swiss taxpayers. We are excited about the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> opportunity to deliver the combined strengths of both firms to an expanded client base. And initial <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> conversations with our clients suggest they agree and recognize the value of the combined organization. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> There is much to do, and there will be difficult decisions to be made over the coming months. Transformations <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> don't happen in a straight line - we know that from our own experience. But we are confident in our ability to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 4 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deliver on the end-state, as well as our existing growth ambition in the U.S. and APAC to create long-term <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> value for all our stakeholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Before I hand over to Sarah, I'd like to provide a brief update on the status of the acquisition. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We have received the required approvals from the Swiss authorities, including FINMA, as well as the UK's PRA <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and the US Federal Reserve. Additional required approvals are being expedited, and we continue to expect the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transaction to close in the second quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Since the deal is pending, we are limited in what we can communicate at this time, but we remain committed <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to providing as much transparency as possible once information becomes available. Sarah will take you through <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our high-level plan to provide you with more information on the transaction. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> One of my immediate priorities is our people across both organizations. We look forward to welcoming our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> new colleagues at UBS. Until closing, we are restricted in the extent we can engage, and we are doing as much <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> as we can given these restrictions. We have a lot of work ahead of us to bring our firms together and this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transaction will present interesting and challenging opportunities to our current and future employees. We will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be one team upon closing of the transaction, and we want the best people to take UBS forward. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I am also focused on establishing our target operating model and organizational structure. It is clear that while <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we manage this integration, we need a model that will allow us to stay close to clients and, deliver on our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ambitions and financial targets while also minimizing distractions. Over the coming weeks, I will provide you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with more information on this. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In summary, our strategy, capital strength, risk management and culture are what have put us in a position <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> today to deliver solid underlying results against a challenging market backdrop. All of these factors will also <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> play an important role as we deliver on our integration plans. While the task ahead of us is challenging and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> urgent, we believe that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents a unique opportunity to generate significant, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> long-term value to all of our stakeholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In particular, I am convinced that this transaction will help to reinforce the leading position of the Swiss financial <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> center and will be of benefit to the entire economy. As we start writing our next chapter, I am looking forward <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to working with my executive team, and my colleagues across UBS and Credit Suisse, to build an organization <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that our clients, employees, shareholders and Switzerland can be proud of. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that, I hand over to Sarah. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 5 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sarah Youngwood <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 8 - 1Q23 net profit USD 1.0bn; 9.1% RoCET1 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Sergio. <MULTISPACE> Good morning, everyone. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Starting on slide 8 - Our first quarter reported net profit of 1 billion dollars included a 665 million provision <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> related to the advanced discussions with the DOJ regarding our legacy RMBS litigation matter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On an underlying basis, we delivered solid results while maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> against an uncertain market backdrop. Underlying profit before tax was 2.4 billion dollars, with a return on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> CET1 of 16.5% and a cost/income ratio of 72.8%, in line with our Group targets. You will find the delta <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> between reported and underlying performance in the appendix. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Underlying revenue was down 8% and expense was down 2%. FX impacted revenue and expense for a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> positive net impact of 15 [edit: 14 million]. The net credit loss expense was 38 million dollars, compared with <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 18 million last year - all low levels, reflecting the high quality of our loan book. With 94% collateralization, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our portfolio remains very resilient in the current environment. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 9 - 1Q23 total revenues USD 8.7bn <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let's start with revenue on slide 9 - Our underlying revenue ex-FX was down 8% with an increase from NII in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> GWM and P&C more than offset by lower asset-based and transaction fees, as well as lower IB revenue. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> What is driving this picture is a macroeconomic environment characterized by a decrease in equity markets as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> well as lower levels of client, M&A and capital market activity versus last year. However, we continued to see <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the benefit of higher rates and solid activity in fixed income. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 10 - Net interest income <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to NII on page 10 - In the first quarter, NII of 2.2 billion dollars was up 520 million, or 31% year-on- <LINEBREAK> year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Quarter-on-quarter, NII was up 3%, in line with overall guidance. This reflects the benefits of our global <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> diversification, as increases in Swiss Franc and Euro more than offset reductions in US Dollar NII. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to the chart, in the second column, the increase was driven by the benefit of rates. This was largely <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offset by changes in deposit mix. <MULTISPACE> Our experience this quarter is in line with the trends we have seen over the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> last year. Our clients have continued to shift some of their balances from sweeps into higher-yielding <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> products. We will come back to money market funds and treasury bonds, but within deposits, clients have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> moved into our attractive saving accounts and CDs. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to deposit volumes - Total deposits decreased 3% sequentially. However, it is important to note that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> these funds have not left our platform. At the start of the year, often based on our investment advice, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have seen clients repositioning from deposits into Money Market funds and Treasuries within our platform. In <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fact, we retained these balances, and on top of that, in GWM, we had 9 billion dollars of net new deposits <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> into UBS mostly driven by the U.S., after March 10. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 6 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Looking ahead, based on the current forwards - For 2Q23, we anticipate a mid-single digit decrease versus <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 1Q23, as slight increases in P&C are expected to be offset by reductions in GWM. We also expect the full year <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to be broadly in line with 4Q annualized. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 11 - Executing our cost strategy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now, turning to costs on page 11 - We had reported operating expense of 7.2 billion. This included the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> litigation provision mentioned earlier and 70 million acquisition costs. Excluding these and FX, this quarter's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> operating expense was down 1%, as reductions in variable comp more than offset inflationary pressures on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> salaries, investments in technology, T&E and redundancy costs. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On redundancy costs, we saw 68 million of expense related to initiatives across GWM, IB and AM this quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We expect the benefit of these actions to materialize in the following quarters. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> For 2023, on a standalone basis, we still expect costs ex-litigation and FX to increase by net 2 to 3% year-on- <LINEBREAK> year and we are on track to deliver on our gross cost saving program of 1.1 billion. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 12 - Global Wealth Management <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Let's move to our businesses - starting with GWM on page 12. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> GWM profit before tax in the quarter was 1.2 billion dollars. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Revenue was 2% lower than last year, with asset-based and transaction revenue down in all regions, partially <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> offset by net interest income. We continue to actively manage deposits across margins, volumes and mix, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> driving NII up 31% year-on-year. NII was down 1% sequentially. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Operating expense ex-litigation and FX was flat year-on-year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We delivered net new money of 28 billion dollars, with net inflows in all regions. Net new fee-generating <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets were 20 billion dollars in the quarter, an annualized growth rate of 6%, mostly into advisory mandates <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and SMAs. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 13 - Asset Management <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to Asset Management, on page 13 - with a profit before tax of 94 million dollars. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Total revenue decreased 13%, with lower net management fees, driven by market headwinds, asset mix and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> FX, as well as lower performance fees net of the pass-through referred to on this page. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The cost/income ratio was 81%, with lower revenue, and operating expense up 1%. The team has taken <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> action to address this negative operating leverage, the benefits of which you will see in the coming quarters. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Net new money in the quarter was 14 billion dollars, delivering a strong net new money annualized growth <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> rate of over 5%. This includes 18 billion dollars into money markets, as we successfully captured client <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> demand for cash-like solutions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 7 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 14 - Investment Bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now onto the IB on slide 14 - The IB delivered 477 million dollars in profit before tax and a 15% return on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> attributed equity. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Revenue in Global Markets of 2.0 billion dollars was down 15% ex-FX, against a record first quarter last year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In Equities, activity levels decreased in all regions, particularly in equity derivatives and cash equities. Despite <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this, we delivered the best quarter on record in our Prime Brokerage and a very strong performance in eFX. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With very different market conditions versus the beginning of last year, we were up 1% in FRC with credit more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> than offsetting FX and Rates. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Global Banking revenue was down 30%, as the positive momentum at the start of the year was interrupted by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the sudden uptick in uncertainty in financials in March, affecting client sentiment. Against this backdrop, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outperformed the global fee pool, with particular strength in APAC and EMEA. Within M&A, we saw market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outperformance across all regions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Operating expense was down 5% ex-litigation and FX, primarily driven by lower variable compensation, and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with cost savings initiatives largely offsetting inflationary pressures on salaries. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 15 - Personal & Corporate Banking (CHF) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Wrapping up on the businesses with the excellent performance in P&C on page 15 - Profit before tax in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> first quarter was 553 million Swiss francs, the best quarter in almost 15 years, when excluding one-off gains. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> This result was largely driven by 32% higher NII. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Overall, total revenue rose 18% year-on-year, including record transaction-based income and stable recurring <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> fees. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We consistently engaged with our clients and were able to deliver 860 million of net new investment <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> products, an annualized growth rate of 16%. We also saw 1.7 billion of net new loans while net new <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> deposits were negative 1.8 billion, as positive flows in Personal Banking were more than offset by outflows in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Corporate and Institutional Clients, mainly driven by investment activities. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We delivered a cost/income ratio of 52%, a 7 percentage point improvement year-over-year. This reflects 5% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> higher costs, largely reflecting technology investments. <MULTISPACE> This consistent focus on our digital transformation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continues to pay off. We saw an 11 percentage point increase year-on-year in the share of Personal Banking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clients that are active mobile users - which benefits our clients and creates operational efficiencies. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 16 - We continued to maintain a strong liquidity and capital position <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Now moving to slide 16 - At times of uncertainty, our clients continue to turn to UBS as a safe harbor. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have a strong capital and liquidity position, risk management, and a balance sheet for all seasons. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> As we continue to prudently manage our resources, we maintained healthy liquidity buffers with an LCR of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> 162% and an NSFR of 118%, broadly stable QoQ. <MULTISPACE> We maintained 144 billion cash balances, which is 29% <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of deposits and more than half of our HQLA. <MULTISPACE> In total, 90% of our HQLA qualifies as level one, which is the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> highest quality of liquid assets. <MULTISPACE> In line with our liquidity management principles, we continue to target a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> diversified funding mix, across regions and products, including deposit types. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 8 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> UBS has not tapped into any of the SNB facilities and we expect to continue not to do so. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 17 - Common equity tier 1 capital <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Moving to capital on page 17 - At 13.9%, we continued to have a strong capital position, comfortably above <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our 13% guidance and 10.4% regulatory requirement. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On the walk - starting at 14.2% at the end of last quarter. Net profit contributed 30 basis points, offset by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital returns to our shareholders at around 50 basis points. The net currency effect was close to nil quarter- <LINEBREAK> on-quarter, as the FX impact on CET1 and RWA offset each other. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In the first quarter, we have repurchased 1.3 billion dollars of shares. While we remain committed to our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital return policy, including progressive dividends and buybacks, we have temporarily suspended share <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> repurchases in light of the planned acquisition of Credit Suisse, and we intend to resume them as soon as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> possible. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 18 - Indicative timing of communication related to the acquisition of Credit Suisse <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> On slide 18 - As you heard from Sergio, we are committed to providing as much transparency as possible, as <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> information becomes available. On this slide, we summarized the sequence of disclosures. Let me highlight a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> few items. The first column refers to the registration statement with the SEC, which is a requirement for the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> close. It will include pro forma financials as of December 31st 2022. Assuming we close as expected in the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> second quarter, 2Q earnings will include consolidated financial statements for the combined Group under IFRS <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and in U.S. Dollars, and in order for us to have time to prepare that information, our earnings date is likely to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> change. After that, we plan to update you regularly. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Slide 19 - Key messages <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Wrapping up - In 1Q23, we delivered a solid set of underlying results with strong flows, as clients continue to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> turn to us for advice and stability in uncertain times. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Looking ahead - the acquisition of Credit Suisse is a great opportunity to accelerate our strategic plans. We <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will execute the work that needs to be done with discipline, while remaining focused on delivering for our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clients, shareholders and all other stakeholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> With that, let's open up for questions. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 9 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Analyst Q&A (CEO and CFO) <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Chis Hallam, Goldman Sachs </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yes. Good morning, everybody. Firstly, on the future capital requirements, at the time of the announcement, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> FINMA said that a larger bank would require higher capital buffers. Have you had any further clarity on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> size of that increase in capital requirement, and particularly to what extent those higher capital requirements <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> may be influenced by the ultimate perimeter of the group? And I suppose any thoughts you have around how <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> those decisions will ultimately feed into the timing of future capital return decisions? That's the first question. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then secondly, in the report this morning, you've outlined that the Emergency Ordinance provides for the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> loss sharing agreement with the Swiss Confederation, but that the Emergency Ordinance will expire within six <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> months of its issuance date, after which time those measures would need to be codified into law by the Swiss <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> parliament. Does that mean that the loss sharing guarantees still are effectively subject to parliamentary <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> approval in six months' time? And if so, what are your confidence levels in getting those approvals? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Thank you. On capital requirements, you know, the situation will be clearer once we determine the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> scope and perimeter of the activities we will run, particularly in respect of non-core activities, and also with <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the businesses that we will exit. This will, of course, have an impact on op-risk, capital charges and so on. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, I think this is one of the issues that Sarah referred to. When we will have more clarity on all those aspects, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we will communicate. But I don't expect this to be something substantial, that will take away the merits and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the value accretion and creation of this transaction. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In respect of the guarantee, we have little doubt that what we have agreed with the government is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> enforceable. Of course, there is a process in place to define exactly the details of this guarantee, and we do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> expect that to be done in the next couple of months. But we are not concerned about the enforceability of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the guarantee as part, as an integral part of our agreements over the weekend to step-in in this situation. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Chris Hallam, Goldman Sachs </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Very clear. Thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. Thanks. Just two questions. The first one is related to the book value per share guidance that you gave <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of the 74% increase on day one. Just wondering if that still holds, first of all, at this point, or has that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> changed post your further analysis. And in that context, should we assume that the purchase accounting, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> restructuring, asset marks, etcetera, should be captured by the reserves that is being built off what we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> estimate 21 billion. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The second question is in relation to more top down. How we should think about the impact on clients at this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> point and also retention of clients, especially in wealth management at this point already. And how we should <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> think about retention of clients post the event, the clients that have left. How should we think about your <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> position after that? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 10 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> So, Sarah, take the first question. I'll take the second. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> So, when we give you the 74%, we focused intentionally on what we viewed as economic impact, i.e., what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> impacts CET1 and if you continue to do it that way, actually the numbers are very stable. Of course, we are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continuing to do the work on the PPA and we're going to continue to do so. And the PPA was, of course, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> included in the estimates that we had given you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Sorry if I may. The 74% also includes - but does clearly not include additional charges to the P&L and the rest <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> comes to the P&L, we should assume. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> That's right. The initial PPA comes into the CET1 or the tangible book value per share, and anything that is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> beyond that comes through the P&L. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Kian Abouhossein, JPMorgan <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Ok. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> So on client retention, I - maybe let me reiterate that if you look at our inflows and in general, we don't have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> an issue with our current clients. And we do believe that in many areas where we were underweight on a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> share of wallet basis we will be able to convince clients that the combined organization is offering a better <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> value. In some areas, of course, we will lose clients because their concentration is going to be too high. And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> last but not least, I do believe that while history doesn't really always repeat itself, we are also convinced that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> many of the clients that were maybe nervous or concerned about what happened at Credit Suisse in the last <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> few months but also post the transaction will regain faith and you know, we will be able to get some of these <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> assets back. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, I'm totally convinced that, you know, our growth and our ability not only to retain but to regain clients <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will be there once we are able to articulate the value proposition that the combined organizations can bring <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to fruits. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Alastair Ryan, Bank of America <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, Sergio. On the comments you made on the Bloomberg TV <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> interview earlier about the importance of centrality, essentiality of ongoing profitability, which was absolutely <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> borne out in recent months. Clearly the combined group has an exceptionally strong capital position on a pro <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> forma basis, which gives you the opportunity to move quite quickly in two ways, one in a sort of actual effect <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the merger and taking financial reserves against that. So, should we think about going quickly as essential <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to your plans because you've got the financial conditions to do it? Clearly, that was something that Credit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 11 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Suisse did not enjoy. They had some ambitions to restructure that they needed to pass through the P&L over <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> time, which constrain their profitability a long way into the future. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Ryan. It is good to be back to interact with you as well. Look, yes, you know what we need to do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> now as we go through the PPA assessment and the marks of the position we find. You can assume that the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> philosophy of running down non-core assets will be the same you saw in the past: based on cost of capital. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, if we are able to dispose, to restructure, any transaction that create a loss that is lower than the cost of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our capital, we will do so without any doubts, any fears of taking upfront losses. So, it's precisely so, as you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> mentioned, that the profitability and the strength we have in our underlying business combined allows us this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> flexibility to control our destiny. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I think, it's very important not to treat those positions as distressed assets, but rather non-core assets. And, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> therefore, an economic consideration has to be put in place. So, every time we can do a transaction that in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our view reduces risk but also frees up capital below our cost of equity, we will do that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And, I guess, this is something that now it takes time for us to go deeper into the analysis of what it is. But <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> this is something I' like to clarify as quickly as possible what it is. So, you can assume that one of our top <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> priorities, to clarify a path of - for us to take down these [assets], to free up this capital going forward and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> also reduce risks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Alastair Ryan, Bank of America <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Flora Bocahut, Jefferies </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yes. Good morning. The first question I wanted to ask you is regarding the net new money, so the net new <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> FGA. You gave us some details you know including post the 10 business days that followed the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> announcement of the deal and thank you for that. I don't think I've seen any comment around the trend in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> April. So, just wanted to ask you know, what trend you've seen in terms of the customer behavior and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> especially regarding the NNFGA as well as customer deposits since the quarter ended about three weeks ago. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then I just wanted to come back to the risk around - the you know concentration risk around clients and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the overlap on the client base. You made interesting comments regarding the fact that you are underweight <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> certain client segment versus CS, and where you can gain from that transaction. There is another client <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> segment which could lose. Can you maybe provide us more details? Do you mean in wealth management <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> specifically, also in P&C? Can you maybe comment on those client segments? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> So, on the first question in terms of the trends of April, we really haven't seen anything that is particularly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> abnormal or special. And so, it is not our custom to guide and we will stay with that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 12 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. On the client side. I mean, if you look at, for example, in Asia, I think it's clear that UBS has that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> perhaps a stronger franchise in North Asia and Credit Suisse has a stronger franchise, relatively speaking, in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Southeast Asia. So, I think that the combination of the two is very complementary. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Latin America, I mean, in Latin America, we definitely have a situation in which Credit Suisse brings a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> significant value to our platform. And there, that will make us, if not the leader of non-Latin American <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> players, very close to that. So, a significant step forward. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In respect of Switzerland, I would say that usually, SMEs have a relationship with maybe one of the large <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> banks and with a cantonal bank or a regional bank. So, it's - there is a high likelihood that the same SMEs <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> don't really have equal a relationship with the two large banks. For that reason, we believe that many of them <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> can be captured. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Same issue for retail and personal clients banking. If people have two relationships, usually they have it with a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> local bank and with a large bank. So, also there. And last but not least, I would say, that it's fair to say that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Credit Suisse has a strong franchise in large corporates in Switzerland, which is also complementary to our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> own. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, after all, as I say, both in terms of current business mix, but also going back to my remarks. In Switzerland, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> there are 250 banks. It's plenty of competition, plenty of cantonal banks, plenty of Raiffeisen Banks. And, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> therefore, we believe that we will be able to manage this competitive landscape, which is not easy for us <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> through service quality and what we can do differently than others rather than just purely size. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Flora Bocahut, Jefferies </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Andrew Coombs, Citi </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Good morning. Two questions. Firstly, just on slide 10 in your revised net interest income outlook, Q1, you've <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seen a slight increase in NII. So then you are guiding to a mid-single digit decrease for Q2. So that implies Q2 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> will be slightly below the Q4 run rate. Implicitly, this seems to suggest that Q3, Q4 is roughly then going to be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stable based on your full year guidance. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, I'm interested in your thoughts on the offset between rate hikes and then most important of all, deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> migration to money market funds in future quarters. Given that we're closing in on peak rates, it seems to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> imply you're achieving, the deposit migration also slows, but would welcome any commentary on that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then my second question is actually on the liquidity coverage ratio. I think there's an active debate as to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> whether it's calibrated correctly in light of recent events, particularly the 10% weighting that's applied to less <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> stable retail deposits. So, interested in any conversations you've had on that either with FINMA or the Basel <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Committee. And likewise, does that mean you're going to continue to run with an LCR of, you know, north <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of 160%, given the potential that that ratio might be recalibrated? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 13 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, on the first quarter or the first question, what you've seen is some very significant mix shift throughout <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the system, the $600 billion of Fed data showed that the whole system had a 3% sequential decrease that we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> still saw. That is not expected to be that dramatic going forward, but we certainly have planned for the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> annualization of that in our numbers. And then after that, you see some normal patterns that happened, but <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> we continue to see some mix shifts, as you would expect, but potentially not at the level that was seen at the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> beginning of the year. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> It's also important to know that for us, it was really the beginning of the year that was that pattern. So, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> actually January and February where we saw a lot of mix shift and actually some of the net inflows into the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> platforms from deposits were in March. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of the second quarter guidance, you've noted that we're going to be down and that is exactly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> correct with P&C being slightly up and GWM, which is where those mix shifts are happening, being a bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> down. And then as you pointed out mathematically, that does mean that there is some level of stability over <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the course of the year thereafter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of LCR, we believe that we are calibrated correctly because what you are seeing also is that for us, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the changes in deposits have actually not done very much in terms of the change of LCR because we very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> much know what type of deposits are going to be sticky versus not sticky. And so, we calculate as such. And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of course, you've seen us very consistently being at those high levels and we don't have an intention to drop <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sharply regardless of the dialogue that could happen around the LCR calculations. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Andrew Coombs, Citi </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Adam Terelak, Mediobanca </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Morning. I've got two. One is a bit of a follow up on LCR and on your long-term funding strategy. Clearly, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> LCR standalone is pretty strong. If you look at the business you're acquiring, then it's really propped up by a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> big SNB liquidity line and that deposits are very, very low. Loans to deposit is 157%. So, I was just wondering <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> how you're thinking about your long-term funding strategy through the acquisition and how you might deal <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with kind of the flight of deposits that they have seen and how you can integrate that into your liquidity <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> model going forward. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then second on a slightly different topic. In GWM, you've got flat costs on lower revenues, and a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> favorable revenue mix with NII up and fees down. Normally, that is a good mix for your cost base. Could you <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> just discuss a little bit more what's going on in there, what sort of inflation you're seeing, whether there is an <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> increased competition for relationship managers, and whether that's changing given the new environment? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood</BOLD> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So on the LCR and more generally the funding plan, as we integrate CS today they are user of the SNB <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> facilities. It will be our intention certainly to manage that down as quickly as possible, but recognizing the gap <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you're pointing out. And we will indicate that as soon as ready. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 14 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of the GWM story, what you're seeing is, as noted, a very strong NII performance. In asset based, it is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the combination of the markets levels as well as a little bit of the margin compression that has happened over <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the year, which is just a mix topic that we have discussed. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then in terms of the transaction activity, not yet very elevated, just based on the level of uncertainty that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> our clients are dealing with. And then what you have seen, though, is on the expense side that we have good <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> rigor where the expense ex-FX and litigation is flat. And so you are offsetting those inflationary pressures by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the good rigor that we are seeing and this is while continuing to be on the offense in terms of our FA <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> recruitment and organic growth. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Adam Terelak, Mediobanca </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Okay. So the inflationary pressure, that sounds quite high to be managed down. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> That's right it's being managed by the offset. And we've done some actions which I've mentioned which in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> total are helping us more on the forward quarter than in the current quarter and also affecting the quarter <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and are still included in our cost being flat. So, really a good performance. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Adam Terelak, Mediobanca </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Jeremy Sigee, Exane </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Morning. Thank you and welcome back to Sergio from me as well. I just want to pick up on a couple of topics <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you've touched on already. Firstly, you talked about the Swiss banks combined market share. I wanted to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clarify, is your plan to fully integrate the two networks under a single brand, single product range, single <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> network, back office, head office? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then secondly, you also touched on the risk shelter. If I read the documents, it seems narrowly defined so <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that it won't cover things like litigation, restructuring, or indeed the operating costs of noncore, only asset <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> disposal losses. So, it seems relatively unlikely to be drawn. So, I just wanted to ask, is it your base case that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> you will draw on that risk shelter or that you also agree it's unlikely that you will draw on that risk shelter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Jeremy. Look, you know, the base plan that we announced on day one when we announced the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transaction was, of course, the full integration. But we reiterated afterwards, and I said it also before that we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are now evaluating what is the best option for the combined businesses going forward. I personally and we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> believe also that there is no - there is no real issue in terms of oversized presence in Switzerland or market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> share topics. I mean, for the reason I mentioned before, we may have to balance what is the best things to do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from a shareholder standpoint of view with other aspects. We will take, in serious consideration, what is the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> best interest of clients? What is the best interest of employees and overall for society? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Having said that, what we need to do is also to make those decisions based on facts and not emotions. Right <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> now, the discussion is totally based on emotions. In many cases, totally uninformed. And we need ourselves <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to understand better those issues before we come to a conclusion. And it's very important not to jump into <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 15 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> any conclusion. Whatever we do has to be sustainable and viable. And therefore, it takes a little bit of time, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> but it won't take forever. We know that both employees, clients and, in general, you as well, you want to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have and we want to have as quickly as possible clarity on what to do. So be patient and in the next few <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> months we will create more clarity on the matter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> In terms of risks, of course, you're right. I mean, first of all, we have to realize that any losses that are coming <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> outside the non-core units are part - will be absorbed by UBS. So, the only item that is subject to the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guarantee is the non-core unit and the first 5 billion of losses coming from that unit is on UBS. So, we have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> almost by default an interest to be prudent in the way we mark this position, and sustainable in the way we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> look at how we disposed those positions. But at the same time, we are also the ones, you know, that want to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> preserve value for our shareholders. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, we will avoid - we will try to avoid at any cost having to tap into the guarantees. But at this stage, it's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> premature to discuss if we have to do it, when we have to do it. This is also a matter that needs to be closed <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> as quickly as possible in terms of creating clarity. So, the next couple of months there will also be very <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> important for us to fully understand the exposures and I'm convinced that this can be done in the timeframe <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that I just outlined. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Jeremy Sigee, Exane </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Great, thank you very much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Anke Reingen, RBC </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yeah. Thank you very much for taking my question. The first is just about the mechanics as you pay with the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> treasury shares if there's a difference versus, yeah, new share issuance just, yeah, conceptually and in terms of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the impact. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then secondly, just a different question on your commercial real estate exposure. Can you give us a bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more detail on the regional mix, potentially maturity profile, LTV and so on? Thank you very much. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> So on the treasury share, what happened is we actually repurchased some of the shares and they are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> available. They could have been cancelled and what we're doing is we are using them for the purpose of this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> acquisition. So, we are not issuing any new shares. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And so in terms of commercial real estate, we have a very conservative portfolio that is - that has exposure to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Switzerland in particular. But - and all of that is according to what you see from us, it was the high <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> collateralization that you would expect. And when we give you all of our levels of reserves, we certainly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reflect on the very high quality of those portfolio. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Anke Reingen, RBC </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 16 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Amit Goel, Barclays </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Hi. Thank you and welcome back, Sergio, too from me. So, two questions. The first, again, just on the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> transaction and the announcement on - on day one, I just wanted to check in terms of the cost savings and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the timeline for EPS accretion whether or not your conviction levels have changed based on the information <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that you have had or seen since then. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then secondly, I was a bit surprised by the amount of, I guess, deposit outflow on a reported basis for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> GWM in the quarter. Do you mind just going through that just going through that in a bit more detail? You <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> know, because obviously that's net of the inflows that we're seeing towards the end of the quarter. So, I <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> appreciate there was a bit of a shift in mix and so forth. But if you could give a bit more color, that would be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> helpful. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Sure. So, in terms of the cost savings and EPS, the assumptions that we gave you stand. And what is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> important is for the EPS accretion to remember that we gave you what were the reported numbers. So, we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are not excluding non-core, we're not excluding restructuring charge. And given that we're dealing with non- <LINEBREAK> core assets that could have a timeline, it could be that some of that comes over time, which is why we gave <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ourselves until 2027. Certainly the core EPS question in our models was faster than that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then in terms of the deposit outflows for GWM, it is really very much the client repositioning that you are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seeing at the beginning of the year. And so, people came in and even with our advisors actually really looked <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> at their portfolios and especially in the U.S., and you've seen that phenomenon, as I mentioned, our deposit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sequential decrease is exactly the same one as the Fed data. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And as a result of people really looking at the difference in particular between what you can have on an after <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> tax basis, between the Treasury bonds or money markets versus any savings products. So, our products are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> very attractive, but nevertheless, the Treasury bonds and money markets end up being more attractive. And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> therefore there have been mix shifts that are very, very logical for that type of clientele. And it is absolutely <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the right advice for clients that is really the majority of the driver and then it's offset by the inflows that we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have gotten since we were a port in the storm during the period of March after things became a bit more <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> difficult for others. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Amit Goel, Barclays </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Thanks. And just on the cost savings, is that kind of, I guess, conditional on what the outcome is for <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the Swiss business? And is the conviction still there on the greater than 8 billion? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> So, the 8 billion-dollars-plus was done based on the base case and, of course, anything beyond that would be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> done in the context of what Sergio said and value creation. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Amit Goel, Barclays </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 17 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. The first is you reiterated the 25% of the new group going <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> forward with the investment bank, but if I combined UBS and Credit Suisse as of Q1, I am already at that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> number before fully transferring the current products and so on? So, does it mean you're already happy with <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the perimeter of the group and potentially happy to diversify your fixed income business via their credit sales <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and trading? Or is this number ultimately going lower towards maybe 20% or whatever the number is? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then, secondly, wondering about global wealth management. Do you re-underwrite the Credit Suisse <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> client from a risk perspective? i.e., is there a new onboarding process or do they just join as of…the deal <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> completing? Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Well, on the 25%, I mean, it depends how you make the calculation. But you know directionally, what we are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> saying is that the 25% on a normalized basis will be the maximum. And from there onwards, we will look <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> into what fits into our risk profile. There are many, many areas where Credit Suisse will bring new capabilities <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> that are good and enhancing our franchise in the investment bank. So we are not concerned about those <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> activities. And as you know, there is also some kind of correlation with risk-weighted assets being a function <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of market movements and volatility. So we can't really right now point out a normalized number that we are <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> happy with other than saying 25% will be the maximum and no matter what. So that's a good starting point. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I think that if you look at the combined organization, we will reduce the weighting of…, going forward. And <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> most importantly, we have a more diversified business. So this is also one of these items where we need a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> little bit of more digging into the business and what is going to stay with us and what is not going to be part <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of our offering. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> The onboarding will be done in a pragmatic way. Unless we have red flags, we will onboard clients. And we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> want to make the journey and the experience of clients as smooth as possible. But of course, the operating <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> model in principle is the one of UBS. So then, as we then on board clients, we will then look at the suitability <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and making sure that they fit into our standards. I don't expect major differences, but here and there, we may <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> have different views on certain client segments or people. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Benjamin Goy; Deutsche Bank </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Understood. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Tom Hallet, KBW </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Good morning, everyone. So, just a couple for me. So, I mean first of all, how concerned are you around the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> revenue attrition already taking place at Credit Suisse? You know I guess where I'm coming from is based on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the current revenue trajectory, the 8 billion of cost reductions might not actually be enough. So, could we be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in a situation where a deeper restructuring is required. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then maybe secondly, around buybacks. I mean, part of the issue there is people are trying to time it and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> obviously, work out the capital and so forth. I suppose that you got one side, you got the government <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guarantees and then on the other, you've got a very politically sensitive situation. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 18 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And I suppose regardless of your capital position, is it fair to assume that buybacks are very much kind of at <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the back of mind for now and we're talking 18 plus months away before you can even consider that between <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the link between obviously your strong capital position - expected capital position and the government <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> guarantees. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thanks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Tom. Now, look, of course, the revenue attrition is a function of what happened in the last couple <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of months. And also, if you look at the - the profitability is highly impacted by the cost of funding they had <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> experienced in the last few months. I think that once things are together and normalized, we will also create <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> some tailwinds in respect of lower cost of funding and an ability to re-attract clients. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> I'm convinced that a lot of the clients will see the value added of the combined businesses and some of those <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> flows will revert. So, of course, we are at the same time, not complacent. So, if we see that this is not <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> enough, we will need to take actions. And, of course, we want to, at the very least, bring back the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> profitability ambitions that we had as a UBS standalone with one of the combined entities. So, cost - focus on <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> efficiency on costs and capital returns and value creation is part of the equation, and we will do the necessary <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> steps to do that. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Look, in terms of buyback, it's way too premature to talk about it. You know, assuming that it takes 18 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> months for clarity, it's a guess that I - you know, I fully understand your point, but believe me, we don't <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> know yet ourselves. So - but we will give you clarity as soon as we have clarity on this matter. We need to be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sensitive to many aspects. But I'm also convinced that it won't take quarters or years to create that clarity. So, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the trajectory of freeing up resources, of creating clarity around the guarantees, creating clarity around the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> business model and our capacity to combine, you know, a dividend policy that sees a constant improvement <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in the cash we pay out combined with share buyback is an important element of our equity story, and we will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be very focused on that in our communication. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Tom Hallet, KBW </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Great. Thanks, Sergio. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Nicholas Payen, Kepler Cheuvreux <MULTISPACE> </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one is for you, Sergio. I would like to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> know if you had noticed anything which was radically different at UBS and its processes, organization, or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> anything between your departure in 2020 and today? And the second question is regarding Americas and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> GWM. There was quite a significant drop in advisors, and I would like to know if there was any underlying <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> reason for this drop. Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you, Nicolas. No. To be honest, it felt [like] I never left. So I think that you don't see any meaningful <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> change. Of course, some things, like is normal, they should change. They should have changed. Not <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> everything I left was perfect, so things needed to be addressed. And other things are very personal and then <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> very - a question of style. But, I mean, the strength of the franchise was only reinforced over the last two <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 19 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> years and this is the reason why we were able to be part of the solution over the weekend, so - which is a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> huge achievement for UBS. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Even if - when you go back into where we were during the financial crisis, in my point of view, this was the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ultimate payback to Switzerland. The fact that UBS was part of the solution was the ultimate payback on what <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the government had to do. And we were always very thankful for that. And so, in that sense, nothing has <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> changed, if anything has been reinforced. And Sarah? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> On GWM, you actually have a technicality, which is that we put in our FA's at both the very high end of FA's, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> but also the people that are in that client advice center, and so it came really mostly from the client advice <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> center. And so really focusing on the flows and the productivity of the FA's is where we are and we are not <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> seeing an issue here. In fact, you have seen the very good flows that we have experienced in the U.S. this <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> quarter. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Nicholas Payen </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Andrew Lim, Société Générale </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Hi. Good morning. And welcome back, Sergio, from me as well. So, my first question is on NII. Appreciate the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> more integrated disclosure on the beta and the migration. I was wondering if you could talk more specifically <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> about how that plays out on a geographical basis. Is that the greater pressure on the beta migration mainly <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from the U.S. side or are we seeing any changes in Europe and Asia as well? And maybe you can give some <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> color on how your NII should pan out based on forward curves into 2024. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> And then my next question is on the IB. Appreciate you've yet to outline the perimeter of what mean - of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> what goes into non-core. But at the same time, you've been very specific about your IB DNA for the past few <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> years now. And so, there's a question mark over the lev fin business which CS lumps with IBD. I guess the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> question is how do you see that business within your IB structure? <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sergio P. Ermotti </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I'll take the second question. I think that, yes, the DNA won't change what we do <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> is part of the equation and having a diversified portfolio of businesses does include also having leverage <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> finance. Of course, we are - we will stay very focused on how we are present in that business. We want to be <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> meaningful to our clients, but also to be mindful that you know, this cannot be the driver of the profitability <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of the investment bank with all associated, you know, volatility and risks. So, you can count on us, or our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> clients can count on us being a relevant player, but definitely, we are not - our ambition is not to be at the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> top of the league just for - and to make it a central part of our model. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, expect at the margins a little bit more, but in a very, very focused way. And we will also look at ways to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> be creative around that business, because there are opportunities for us to also partner with other institutions <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on how to manage, you know residual risk. So, our ability has to be to be the bridge in the investment bank <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> between different sources of capital and not necessarily originate and store risks. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
<PAGE_BREAK>
<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 20 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Sarah Youngwood </BOLD> <LINEBREAK> In terms of the NII, so, looking at it by region and really by currency is how we think about it. What you have, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> first of all, as a broad statement is that for each product category in each region and the realized beta at or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> below the modelled beta. But then what you have is you have mix shifts within the deposit products which <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are yielding those higher overall, on basically repricing. And what we are seeing is then based on where we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> are in the cycle. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So in the U.S., where those very high rates where we are at very high incremental betas. And that's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> continuing with the mix shift that I've discussed in the best interest of the clients. And then you have in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Europe, we went from being really at fairly low levels to - now moving into a place where there is price <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sensitivity, especially for GWM clients. So, you have seen an increase, which is totally planned, but a little bit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of mix shift also there, but a bit less on the mix shift there. And then on - in Switzerland, you've got a mix <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> where you've got the P&C, especially in Personal Banking where you still have a very low level of rates in all of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Switzerland. And we have put in place appropriate levels of pricing actions, but yet have - or are still in that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> place in the cycle where you are seeing less of a shift or repricing just based on where the currencies are. So, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> going into the next year, you're continuing to go higher for all of the currencies and 2024, really, it will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> depend on the rate path. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Sergio P. Ermotti - closing remarks <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Okay. Looks like there are no more questions. Thank you for being with us this morning. As I said, despite the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> very uncertain market conditions, we delivered solid underlying results for the quarter. We have been <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> maintaining our capital and liquidity positions, and we were also able to get very close to resolve a legacy <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> matter that has been with us for 15 years. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> We discussed also the unique opportunity that the acquisition of Credit Suisse presents not only for our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> shareholders, but I believe also for all the rest of our stakeholders, employees, clients, society at large. And of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> course, this is not going to be a straight line journey. You know, it's going to be a challenging one, is a <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> complex one. But I do believe that, you know, the benefits outweigh by far, all those factors. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> So, I know that you are looking for more details. We are also you are looking for more details. And we will <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> really do our best to keep the communication channels open over the next few weeks and months so that we <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> can provide the necessary information to have a better understanding of this great equity story ahead of us. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Thank you. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>

<MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Page 21 of 21 <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <BOLD>Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements |</BOLD> This document contains statements that constitute "forward-looking statements," <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> including but not limited to management's outlook for UBS's financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> strategic initiatives on UBS's business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> these forward-looking statements represent UBS's judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS's expectations. The Russia-Ukraine war has led to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> heightened volatility across global markets, exacerbated global inflation, and slowed global growth. In addition, the war has caused significant population <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> displacement, and if the conflict continues or escalates, the scale of disruption will increase and continue to cause shortages of vital commodities, including <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> energy shortages and food insecurity, and may lead to recessions in OECD economies. The coordinated sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty as to whether the war will widen and intensify, may have significant adverse effects on the market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> statements. In addition, turmoil in the banking industry has increased and, at the urging of Swiss authorities, UBS has announced historic plans to merge <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> with another global systemically important bank in Switzerland. The transaction creates considerable integration risk. Other factors that may affect our <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> the ongoing execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from higher market volatility; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> other conditions; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, deterioration or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, market <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS's clients and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it, which have <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> had and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> labor market displacements; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS's credit spreads and credit ratings <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS's business activities; (vii) UBS's <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements, or other developments; (viii) UBS's ability to maintain and improve its systems and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> controls for complying with sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> (x) changes in UBS's competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> adversely affect UBS's ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, as well as the amount of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS's business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> developments and of possible changes in UBS's policies and practices; (xiv) UBS's ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> matters; (xvi) UBS's ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> of UBS's internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> increased with cyberattack threats from nation states; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> FINMA or the regulators of UBS's operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS's ability <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> conflict between different governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> successfully recover from a disaster or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g., the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Russia-Ukraine war), pandemic, security breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> ability to function remotely during long-term disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities currently existing in the Credit Suisse group (which is expected to become part of UBS), the level of <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consumption of the integration on the operational results, share price and credit rating of UBS - <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, contractual and operational <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may have on our reputation <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are presented is not <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be affected by <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). More <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including UBS's Annual Report <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> on Form 20-F for the year ended 31 December 2022. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) update or alter its <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK> <MULTISPACE> <LINEBREAK>
